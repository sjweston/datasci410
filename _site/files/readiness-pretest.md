# PSY 410: Data Science for Psychology
## Course Readiness Pre-Test

**Purpose:** This brief assessment helps you determine if you're prepared for PSY 410. It covers foundational concepts from research methods and statistics that we'll build upon throughout the course.

**Instructions:** Select the best answer for each question. This is **not graded** and will not affect your enrollment. If you struggle with several questions, we recommend reviewing your research methods and statistics materials before the course begins.

**Scoring Guide:**
- **14-16 correct:** You're well-prepared!
- **10-13 correct:** You're mostly ready. Review any missed concepts before class.
- **Below 10:** Consider refreshing your research methods and statistics knowledge before the course.

**Correct Answer:** b

---

### 5. In an experiment testing a new study technique, one group uses the new technique while another group studies as usual. The "study as usual" group is called the:

a) Experimental group
b) Control group
c) Dependent variable
d) Random group

**Correct Answer:** b

---

### 6. A Likert scale item asks: "I feel confident in my abilities" with response options from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 5 (Strongly Agree). A participant who is very confident would most likely choose:

a) 1
b) 2
c) 3
d) 5

**Correct Answer:** d

---

### 7. A questionnaire measures "self-esteem" using 10 different items that are averaged together. This average is called a:

a) Likert scale
b) Composite score
c) Control variable
d) Median response

**Correct Answer:** b

---

### 8. A survey item states: "I often feel anxious" (1 = Never, 5 = Always). To measure calmness, a researcher includes: "I feel relaxed" with the same scale. If someone answers "5" (Always) to "I feel relaxed," this should count the same as answering "1" (Never) to "I feel anxious." This is an example of:

a) A subscale
b) A control condition
c) A reverse-coded item
d) A dependent variable

**Correct Answer:** c

---

### 9. A memory study measures participants' recall BEFORE and AFTER a training session. This is an example of:

a) Between-subjects design
b) Control group design
c) Cross-sectional design
d) Pre-test/post-test design

**Correct Answer:** d

---

### 10. In a study, each participant completes a task under BOTH a high-stress condition and a low-stress condition. This is:

a) A between-subjects design
b) A repeated measures (within-subjects) design
c) A control group design
d) A pre-test design

**Correct Answer:** b

---

### 11. Two groups of participants (Group A and Group B) each receive a different type of therapy. Each participant is in only ONE group. This is:

a) A within-subjects design
b) A repeated measures design
c) A between-subjects design
d) A pre-test/post-test design

**Correct Answer:** c

---

### 12. A well-being questionnaire has three subscales: Life Satisfaction (5 items), Positive Emotions (4 items), and Purpose (6 items). A researcher calculates separate scores for each subscale and also a total well-being score. How many composite scores does each participant have?

a) 1 (only the total)
b) 3 (one for each subscale)
c) 4 (three subscales plus the total)
d) 15 (one for each item)

**Correct Answer:** c

---

### 13. You need to send your research advisor a data file. The file is located at: `Documents/Research/Spring2025/survey_data.csv`. Which part of this path tells you the file type?

a) Documents
b) Spring2025
c) survey_data
d) .csv

**Correct Answer:** d

---

### 14. A dataset contains information about 100 college students, including their age, major, and GPA. In this dataset, what does each ROW represent?

a) A variable being measured
b) An individual student
c) A type of measurement (age, major, or GPA)
d) The average across all students

**Correct Answer:** b

---

### 15. In the same dataset of 100 students with columns for student_id, age, major, and GPA, what would we call "age"?

a) An observation
b) A case
c) A participant
d) A variable

**Correct Answer:** d

---

### 16. A researcher wants to find participants who are psychology majors AND have a GPA above 3.5. If a student is a biology major with a 3.8 GPA, would they be included?

a) Yes, because they meet one of the criteria
b) Yes, because their GPA is above 3.5
c) No, because they must meet BOTH criteria
d) No, because biology majors are excluded from all studies

**Correct Answer:** c

## What These Results Mean

### Strong Foundation (14-16 correct)
You have solid understanding of the research methods and statistics concepts we'll build upon. You're ready for PSY 410!

### Good Foundation (10-13 correct)
You have most of the foundational knowledge needed. Review the concepts from questions you missed, particularly focusing on:
- Questions 1-4: Descriptive statistics concepts
- Questions 3, 5: Experimental design terminology
- Questions 6-8, 12: Survey/questionnaire structures
- Questions 9-11: Research design terminology
- Question 13: File organization and file types
- Questions 14-15: Data structure concepts
- Question 16: Logical operators

### Needs Review (Below 10 correct)
Consider reviewing your research methods and introductory statistics materials before PSY 410 begins. Focus on:
- Consider reviewing descriptive statistics: What do mean, median, and standard deviation tell us about data?
- Consider reviewing experimental design: Independent vs. dependent variables, experimental vs. control groups
- **Survey design**: Likert scales, composite scores, reverse-coding
- **Research designs**: Within-subjects vs. between-subjects, pre-test/post-test
- **Data organization**: Understanding rows, columns, variables, and observations in datasets
- **File management**: Recognizing file types and understanding file paths
- **Logical thinking**: AND/OR logic in selecting or filtering data

**Recommended review resources:**
- Your PSY 201/202 (Research Methods) textbook, especially chapters on experimental design and measurement
- Your statistics course notes on descriptive statistics
- Khan Academy: Statistics and Probability (Introduction to Statistics section)
