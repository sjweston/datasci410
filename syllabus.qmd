## Course Description

This course introduces psychology majors to modern data science tools and techniques using R and the tidyverse. Students will learn to import, tidy, transform, visualize, and communicate data effectively. The course emphasizes practical skills for working with real psychological data, reproducible research practices, and creating publication-ready visualizations.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

1. **Import and tidy data** from various sources (CSV, Excel) into analysis-ready formats
2. **Transform data** using dplyr verbs (filter, select, mutate, summarize, join)
3. **Create effective visualizations** using ggplot2, applying principles of visual perception and design
4. **Conduct exploratory data analysis** to understand patterns and relationships in data
5. **Produce reproducible reports** using Quarto that integrate code, results, and narrative
6. **Communicate findings** through well-designed figures that tell a clear story

### AI Tools Policy

**TL;DR: No AI tools in this course. But plan to use AI extensively in your future career.**

AI tools like ChatGPT, Claude, and GitHub Copilot are transforming data science work. You *should* learn to use them effectively — but not yet. This course prohibits AI assistance on all assessments:

- Weekly coding assignments
- In-class coding exercises
- Reading quizzes
- Final project

**Why no AI?**

Think of it like going to the gym. You don't hire someone to lift the weights for you — the struggle *is* the point. The goal is to build mental muscle: understanding why code works, debugging when it doesn't, and developing intuition about data structures.

Using AI before you have these foundations creates an "illusion of competence." The code works, so it *feels* like you understand it. But when the AI hallucinates (and it will), you can't debug it. You're stranded.

Research shows that AI coding tools are most effective when used for *augmentation* (enhancing what you already know) rather than *automation* (doing what you don't understand). In [Anthropic's Economic Index (January 2026)](https://www.anthropic.com/research/anthropic-economic-index-january-2026-report), AI output quality was strongly correlated with the user's education level and domain expertise — AI amplifies your existing skills, it doesn't replace them (Anthropic, 2026).

By building a strong foundation now, you'll be in a far better position to leverage AI as a collaborator in your future work.


## Grading

| Component | Weight | Details |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Weekly Coding Assignments | 35% | 8 assignments, lowest 1 dropped |
| Reading Quizzes | 15% | 10 quizzes, lowest 2 dropped |
| In-Class Participation | 15% | Completion-based coding exercises |
| Final Project | 35% | Includes proposal, draft, and final submission |

### Weekly Coding Assignments (35%)

Short, focused exercises that reinforce each session's content. These are due before the next class meeting and are designed to take 1-2 hours outside of class. You'll have time during class to start these and ask questions.

### Reading Quizzes (15%)

Brief Canvas quizzes on the R4DS readings, completed before class. These are timed and use Lockdown Browser. The goal is to ensure you come to class prepared.

### In-Class Participation (15%)

During each class, you'll work with a partner on coding exercises. These are graded on completion and good-faith effort, not correctness. This is your time to experiment, make mistakes, and learn from each other.

### Final Project (35%)

A capstone project where you'll apply everything you've learned to analyze a dataset of your choosing. The project has three checkpoints:

- **Proposal** (Week 5): Dataset selection and research questions
- **Draft** (Week 8): Working code and preliminary results
- **Final Submission** (Week 10): Polished Quarto report with visualizations and narrative

You'll also give a brief (5-minute) presentation during finals week.
