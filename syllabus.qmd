## Course Description

This course introduces psychology majors to modern data science tools and techniques using R and the tidyverse. Students will learn to import, tidy, transform, visualize, and communicate data effectively. The course emphasizes practical skills for working with real psychological data, reproducible research practices, and creating publication-ready visualizations.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

1. **Import and tidy data** from various sources (CSV, Excel) into analysis-ready formats
2. **Transform data** using dplyr verbs (filter, select, mutate, summarize, join)
3. **Create effective visualizations** using ggplot2, applying principles of visual perception and design
4. **Conduct exploratory data analysis** to understand patterns and relationships in data
5. **Produce reproducible reports** using Quarto that integrate code, results, and narrative
6. **Communicate findings** through well-designed figures that tell a clear story

### AI Tools Policy

AI tools like ChatGPT, Claude, and GitHub Copilot are increasingly part of professional data science workflows, and learning to use them effectively is a valuable skill. However, this course focuses on building foundational skills that AI cannot replace: understanding *why* code works, debugging when it doesn't, and developing the judgment to know when output is correct.

For this reason, assessments in this course fall into two categories:

**AI-Restricted Assessments:**

- In-class coding exercises
- Timed reading quizzes (Canvas with Lockdown Browser)

These must be completed without AI assistance. The goal is to build your mental models and muscle memory for R programming.

**AI-Permitted Assessments (with documentation):**

- Weekly coding assignments
- Final project

For these assessments, you may use AI tools, but you must:

1. **Cite your use** — Note which tool you used and for what purpose
2. **Document the process** — Include a brief reflection on what the AI got right, what it got wrong, and what you had to modify
3. **Understand your code** — You should be able to explain every line. I may ask you to walk me through your code verbally.

**Why this approach?** Learning to code is like learning a language — you need to struggle through the basics before a translator becomes useful rather than a crutch. Once you understand the fundamentals, AI becomes a powerful collaborator rather than a black box.

## Grading

| Component | Weight | Details |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Weekly Coding Assignments | 35% | 8 assignments, lowest 1 dropped |
| Reading Quizzes | 15% | 10 quizzes, lowest 2 dropped |
| In-Class Participation | 15% | Completion-based coding exercises |
| Final Project | 35% | Includes proposal, draft, and final submission |

### Weekly Coding Assignments (35%)

Short, focused exercises that reinforce each session's content. These are due before the next class meeting and are designed to take 1-2 hours outside of class. You'll have time during class to start these and ask questions.

### Reading Quizzes (15%)

Brief Canvas quizzes on the R4DS readings, completed before class. These are timed and use Lockdown Browser. The goal is to ensure you come to class prepared.

### In-Class Participation (15%)

During each class, you'll work with a partner on coding exercises. These are graded on completion and good-faith effort, not correctness. This is your time to experiment, make mistakes, and learn from each other.

### Final Project (35%)

A capstone project where you'll apply everything you've learned to analyze a dataset of your choosing. The project has three checkpoints:

- **Proposal** (Week 5): Dataset selection and research questions
- **Draft** (Week 8): Working code and preliminary results
- **Final Submission** (Week 10): Polished Quarto report with visualizations and narrative

You'll also give a brief (5-minute) presentation during finals week.
