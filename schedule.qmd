### Session 15: Storytelling with Data
**Wednesday, May 20**

*Drawing from Knaflic's "Storytelling with Data"*

1. **Understand the context** — Audience, message, and the Big Idea; 3-minute story; storyboarding
2. **Choose appropriate visuals** — Review: continuous → line/scatter; categorical → bars; avoid pies, 3D, dual axes
3. **Eliminate clutter** — Gestalt principles; strategic contrast; alignment and whitespace
4. **Focus attention** — Preattentive attributes (color, size, position); "Where are your eyes drawn?" test
5. **Think like a designer** — Visual affordances and hierarchy; accessibility; colorblind-friendly palettes
