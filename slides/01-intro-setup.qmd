# Why are we here? {background-color="#2c3e50"}

## Psychology has a data problem

In 2015, a team of 270 researchers tried to replicate 100 published psychology studies.

. . .

**Only 36% produced the same results.**

. . .

This wasn't fraud. These were real labs, following published methods, using real data.

So what went wrong?

## Many things went wrong

- Analyses that couldn't be reproduced (even by the original authors)
- Data that was cleaned by hand with no record of what changed
- Figures that obscured rather than revealed patterns
- Code that only worked on one person's laptop

. . .

The replication crisis isn't just a statistics problem. It's a **workflow** problem.

## This course is about the workflow

Every technical skill we learn this quarter serves the same goal:

. . .

> Start with raw data. End with a clear, honest, reproducible story.

. . .

That means learning to:

- **Import** data without breaking it
- **Transform** it transparently (with code, not clicks)
- **Visualize** it to find patterns — and catch errors
- **Communicate** what you found so others can verify it

## About this course

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**What we'll learn:**

- Data visualization with ggplot2
- Data transformation with dplyr
- Data tidying with tidyr
- Reproducible reports with Quarto
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Why it matters:**

- Psychology is increasingly data-driven
- These skills make your work reproducible
- They transfer to any career that touches data
:::
::::

## The old way vs. the new way

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Point-and-click (SPSS, Excel)**

- Hard to reproduce
- Error-prone
- Limited visualizations
- Doesn't scale
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Code-based (R)**

- Fully reproducible
- Transparent & shareable
- Unlimited customization
- Handles any data size
:::
::::

## Why R specifically?

- **Free and open source** — no expensive licenses
- **Designed for data analysis** — built by statisticians
- **Massive community** — packages for everything
- **Psychology-friendly** — `psych`, `lavaan`, `lme4`, `brms`...
- **Beautiful visualizations** — ggplot2 is industry-leading
- **Reproducible research** — Quarto integration

# Getting set up {background-color="#2c3e50"}

## What you need to install

1. **R** — the programming language
   - Download from [cloud.r-project.org](https://cloud.r-project.org)

2. **RStudio** — the interface we'll use to write R
   - Download from [posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)

. . .

::: {.callout-important}
Install R **first**, then RStudio. RStudio needs R to work!
:::

## R vs RStudio

Think of it like this:

- **R** is the engine of a car
- **RStudio** is the dashboard, steering wheel, and GPS

You *could* drive with just an engine... but why would you?

## The RStudio interface

![](img/rstudio-panes.png){fig-alt="RStudio interface showing four panes" width="80%"}

::: {.notes}
The four panes: Source (top-left), Console (bottom-left), Environment (top-right), Files/Plots/Help (bottom-right)
:::

## The four panes

| Pane | What it does |
|------|--------------|
| **Source** (top-left) | Write and edit your code files |
| **Console** (bottom-left) | Run code interactively, see output |
| **Environment** (top-right) | See your data and objects |
| **Files/Plots/Help** (bottom-right) | Navigate files, view plots, get help |

## Let's try it: The Console

Type in the Console and press Enter:

```{r}
2 + 2
```

. . .

```{r}
#| eval: true
2 + 2
```

Congrats — you just ran R code!

## The assignment operator

In R, we use `<-` to assign values to objects:
```{r}
x <- 10
```

Think of it as an arrow pointing left: "put 10 into x"

. . .

```{r}
# You can use objects in calculations
x * 2
x + x
```

. . .

# Organizing your work {background-color="#2c3e50"}

## Two mental models

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

### The filing cabinet

Every piece of paper has a **place** where it *lives*.

You navigate **to** that place to find it.

```
Documents/
├── psy410/
│   ├── data/
│   └── scripts/
└── thesis/
    ├── data/
    └── drafts/
```

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

### The laundry basket

Everything is in **one pile**.

You **search** to find it.

<br>

*Google, Spotlight, Finder search, "Recent files"...*

:::
::::

. . .

Neither is wrong for daily life. But **coding requires the filing cabinet.**

## Why coding requires the filing cabinet

When you write:

```{r}
survey <- read.csv("data/raw/survey_responses.csv")
```

You're giving directions: "Start here. Go into `data`. Then into `raw`. Find `survey_responses.csv`."

. . .

If the file isn't exactly there, the code **breaks**. No fuzzy matching. No "did you mean...?"

. . .

::: {.callout-important}
This is why we need to learn directory structure — even if it feels foreign.
:::

## Why use RStudio Projects?

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Without projects:**

- Files scattered everywhere
- `setwd()` nightmares
- "It works on my computer"
- Lost work when switching tasks
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**With projects:**

- Everything in one folder
- Paths just work
- Share the whole folder
- Easy to switch between projects
:::
::::

. . .

::: {.callout-tip}
**The golden rule:** Someone else should be able to run your code and get the same results. That "someone else" includes Future You — who has forgotten everything.
:::

## Creating a project

1. File → New Project...
2. Choose "New Directory" → "New Project"
3. Name it (e.g., "psy410")
4. Pick a location (Documents folder is fine)
5. Click "Create Project"

. . .

You'll see a `.Rproj` file appear — this is your project file. From now on, double-click it to open your project.

## A standard project structure

```
psy410/
├── psy410.Rproj
├── data/
│   ├── raw/           # Original data (READ ONLY)
│   └── clean/         # Processed data
├── scripts/
│   ├── 01_clean.R     # Data cleaning
│   ├── 02_analyze.R   # Main analysis
│   └── 03_visualize.R # Figures
└── output/
    └── figures/       # Saved plots
```

. . .

Two principles:

1. **Raw data is sacred** — never modify original files
2. **Outputs are disposable** — you can always regenerate them from code

## Naming things

Good names make code **self-documenting**. Bad names create confusion and bugs.

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Do this:**

- `reaction_time`
- `mean_anxiety`
- `survey_clean.csv`
- `01_clean_data.R`
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Not this:**

- `x1`, `temp`, `foo`
- `AvgAnx` (hard to read)
- `data_final_v2_REAL.csv`
- `stuff.R`, `untitled3.R`
:::
::::

. . .

The test: Can someone unfamiliar with your project understand what a variable contains or what a file does?

## R Scripts

R scripts (`.R` files) are where you write and save your code.

To create one:

1. File → New File → R Script
2. Or press Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + N

. . .

**Always save your scripts!** The console history disappears.

## Running code from a script

- **Run one line:** Put cursor on line, press Ctrl/Cmd + Enter
- **Run selection:** Highlight code, press Ctrl/Cmd + Enter
- **Run entire script:** Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + Enter

. . .

::: {.callout-tip}
You'll use Ctrl/Cmd + Enter constantly. Memorize it!
:::

## Comments

Use `#` to write comments — notes for yourself and others:

```{r}
# This calculates the mean age of participants
mean_age <- mean(ages)

# Anything after # is ignored by R
x <- 10  # this assigns 10 to x
```

Comments are essential. Your future self will thank you.

# Your first real task {background-color="#2c3e50"}

## Installing packages

R's power comes from **packages** — bundles of functions others have written.

```{r}
# Install a package (do this once)
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

```{r}
# Load a package (do this every session)
library(tidyverse)
```

## The tidyverse

The `tidyverse` is actually a collection of packages:

| Package | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `ggplot2` | Data visualization |
| `dplyr` | Data manipulation |
| `tidyr` | Data tidying |
| `readr` | Reading data files |
| `tibble` | Modern data frames |
| `stringr` | String manipulation |
| `forcats` | Working with factors |
| `purrr` | Functional programming |

We'll use most of these throughout the course.

## Let's look at some data

After loading tidyverse, you have access to built-in datasets:

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: true
library(tidyverse)

# mpg is a dataset about fuel economy
mpg
```

## Your turn!

1. Create a new RStudio Project called "psy410"
2. Inside it, create three folders: `data`, `scripts`, `output`
3. Create a new R script in `scripts/` and save it as `01_practice.R`
4. Install and load the tidyverse
5. Run `glimpse(mpg)` and `glimpse(diamonds)`
6. Save your script!

# Getting help {background-color="#2c3e50"}

## When you're stuck

1. **Use `?`** — e.g., `?mean` opens the help page
2. **Google it** — seriously, everyone does this
3. **Stack Overflow** — most R questions are answered there
4. **R4DS book** — [r4ds.hadley.nz](https://r4ds.hadley.nz)
5. **Ask me** — that's what I'm here for!

## Reading help pages

```{r}
?mean
```

Help pages include:

- **Description** — what the function does
- **Usage** — how to call it
- **Arguments** — what inputs it takes
- **Examples** — working code you can run

The examples section is gold — run them!

## Error messages

Errors will happen. A lot. That's normal.

```{r}
#| error: true
#| eval: true
# This will error - can you spot why?
maen(c(1, 2, 3))
```

. . .

Read the error message carefully — R is trying to help you.

I encourage you to read ["Cognitive helmets for AI bicycles"](https://www.fightforthehuman.com/cognitive-helmets-for-the-ai-bicycle-part-1/) by Cat Hicks.

*   **Steve Jobs (1980):** The computer is a "Bicycle for the mind."
    *   *It amplifies your pedaling.*
    *   *You still provide the balance and direction.*
*   **Generative AI (2024):** It's more like a **Motorcycle**.
    *   *It provides the engine/speed.*
    *   *If you don't know how to ride, you crash faster and harder.*

---

### The problem: The "illusion of competence"

*   **Psychological concept:** *Metacognition* (monitoring your own understanding).
*   **The trap:**
    *   AI gives you a working answer immediately.
    *   It *feels* like you solved it (dopamine hit!).
    *   But you didn't build the **mental model** of *why* it works.
*   **The result:** When the AI hallucinates (which it will), you cannot debug it. You are stranded.

---

### The solution: "Cognitive helmets"

*   Before we get on the AI motorcycle, we need a **cognitive helmet**.
*   **What is the helmet?**
    1.  **Syntax literacy:** Reading code as fluently as English.
    2.  **Debugging resilience:** Emotional regulation when things break.
    3.  **Strategic friction:** The ability to break a big problem into small pieces.


---

### Course structure: Building the helmet

*   **Many short assignments**
    *   This is **"desirable difficulty."**
    *   We are building the neural pathways for code syntax.
    *   Small wins build the mental model of how data is structured.
*   **Why "maladaptive easy"?**
    *   Using AI now = skipping the gym but expecting to get strong.
    *   It bypasses the *encoding process* in your brain.

---

### The future: When do we use AI?

*   We **will** use AI in this field (and perhaps this course later).
*   **But only when you have your helmet.**
*   **The goal:** You should be the **pilot**, not the passenger.
    *   *You* define the problem.
    *   *You* verify the code.
    *   *You* catch the errors.

# Wrapping up {background-color="#2c3e50"}

## Before next class

**Read:**

- [R4DS Ch 2: Workflow basics](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/workflow-basics)
- [R4DS Ch 6: Workflow: scripts and projects](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/workflow-scripts)

**Do:**

- Install R and RStudio
- Create your psy410 project with `data/`, `scripts/`, and `output/` folders
- Install the tidyverse package
- Poke around! Try things! Break stuff!

## Key takeaways

1. **Psychology needs better data practices** — that's what this course builds
2. **R is a tool** — like learning any tool, it takes practice
3. **Organization matters** — filing cabinet, not laundry basket
4. **Name things clearly** — your future self will thank you
5. **Errors are learning opportunities** — read them, Google them

## The one thing to remember

Every skill you learn in this course is a brick in a wall between you and the replication crisis.

See you Wednesday for your first visualization!
