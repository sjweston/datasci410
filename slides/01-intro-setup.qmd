# Welcome to PSY 410! {background-color="#2c3e50"}

## About this course

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**What we'll learn:**

- Data visualization with ggplot2
- Data transformation with dplyr
- Data tidying with tidyr
- Reproducible research with Quarto
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Why it matters:**

- Psychology is increasingly data-driven
- Reproducibility crisis demands better practices
- These skills are transferable everywhere
:::
::::

## Why data science for psychology?

Psychology research involves:

- Collecting data from experiments, surveys, observations
- Cleaning messy real-world data
- Visualizing patterns and relationships
- Communicating findings clearly

. . .

**Data science gives us tools to do all of this better.**

## The old way vs. the new way

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Point-and-click (SPSS, Excel)**

- Hard to reproduce
- Error-prone
- Limited visualizations
- Doesn't scale
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Code-based (R)**

- Fully reproducible
- Transparent & shareable
- Unlimited customization
- Handles any data size
:::
::::

## Why R specifically?

- **Free and open source** — no expensive licenses
- **Designed for statistics** — built by statisticians for data analysis
- **Massive community** — packages for everything
- **Psychology-friendly** — `psych`, `lavaan`, `lme4`, `brms`...
- **Beautiful visualizations** — ggplot2 is industry-leading
- **Reproducible research** — Quarto/RMarkdown integration

# Getting set up {background-color="#2c3e50"}

## What you need to install

1. **R** — the programming language
   - Download from [cloud.r-project.org](https://cloud.r-project.org)

2. **RStudio** — the interface we'll use to write R
   - Download from [posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)

. . .

::: {.callout-important}
Install R **first**, then RStudio. RStudio needs R to work!
:::

## R vs RStudio

Think of it like this:

- **R** is the engine of a car
- **RStudio** is the dashboard, steering wheel, and GPS

You *could* drive with just an engine... but why would you?

## The RStudio interface

![](img/rstudio-panes.png){fig-alt="RStudio interface showing four panes" width="80%"}

::: {.notes}
The four panes: Source (top-left), Console (bottom-left), Environment (top-right), Files/Plots/Help (bottom-right)
:::

## The four panes

| Pane | What it does |
|------|--------------|
| **Source** (top-left) | Write and edit your code files |
| **Console** (bottom-left) | Run code interactively, see output |
| **Environment** (top-right) | See your data and objects |
| **Files/Plots/Help** (bottom-right) | Navigate files, view plots, get help |

## Let's try it: The Console

Type in the Console and press Enter:

```{r}
2 + 2
```

. . .

```{r}
#| eval: true
2 + 2
```

Congrats — you just ran R code!

## More console experiments

```{r}
# R can do math
10 * 5
sqrt(144)
```

```{r}
# R has built-in functions
mean(c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5))
```

```{r}
# R can store things in objects
my_number <- 42
my_number * 2
```

## The assignment operator

In R, we use `<-` to assign values to objects:
```{r}
x <- 10
```

Think of it as an arrow pointing left: "put 10 into x"

. . .

# Projects & workflow {background-color="#2c3e50"}

## Why use RStudio Projects?

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Without projects:**

- Files scattered everywhere
- `setwd()` nightmares
- "It works on my computer"
- Lost work when switching tasks
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**With projects:**

- Everything in one folder
- Paths just work
- Share the whole folder
- Easy to switch between projects
:::
::::

## Creating a project

1. File → New Project...
2. Choose "New Directory" → "New Project"
3. Name it (e.g., "psy410")
4. Pick a location (Documents folder is fine)
5. Click "Create Project"

. . .

You'll see a `.Rproj` file appear — this is your project file.

## Project folder structure

A good project folder might look like:

```
psy410/
├── psy410.Rproj
├── data/
│   └── survey_data.csv
├── scripts/
│   └── analysis.R
└── output/
    └── figures/
```

Keep your work organized from the start!

## R Scripts

R scripts (`.R` files) are where you write and save your code.

To create one:

1. File → New File → R Script
2. Or press Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + N

. . .

**Always save your scripts!** The console history disappears.

## Running code from a script

- **Run one line:** Put cursor on line, press Ctrl/Cmd + Enter
- **Run selection:** Highlight code, press Ctrl/Cmd + Enter
- **Run entire script:** Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + Enter

. . .

::: {.callout-tip}
You'll use Ctrl/Cmd + Enter constantly. Memorize it!
:::

## Comments

Use `#` to write comments — notes for yourself and others:

```{r}
# This calculates the mean age of participants
mean_age <- mean(ages)

# Anything after # is ignored by R
x <- 10  # this assigns 10 to x
```

Comments are essential. Your future self will thank you.

# Your first real task {background-color="#2c3e50"}

## Installing packages

R's power comes from **packages** — bundles of functions others have written.

```{r}
# Install a package (do this once)
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

```{r}
# Load a package (do this every session)
library(tidyverse)
```

## The tidyverse

The `tidyverse` is actually a collection of packages:

| Package | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `ggplot2` | Data visualization |
| `dplyr` | Data manipulation |
| `tidyr` | Data tidying |
| `readr` | Reading data files |
| `tibble` | Modern data frames |
| `stringr` | String manipulation |
| `forcats` | Working with factors |
| `purrr` | Functional programming |

We'll use most of these throughout the course.

## Let's look at some data

After loading tidyverse, you have access to built-in datasets:

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: true
library(tidyverse)

# mpg is a dataset about fuel economy
glimpse(mpg)
```

## Your turn!

1. Create a new RStudio Project called "psy410"
2. Create a new R script
3. Install and load the tidyverse
4. Run `glimpse(mpg)` and `glimpse(diamonds)`
5. Save your script!

# Getting help {background-color="#2c3e50"}

## When you're stuck

1. **Use `?`** — e.g., `?mean` opens the help page
2. **Google it** — seriously, everyone does this
3. **Stack Overflow** — most R questions are answered there
4. **R4DS book** — [r4ds.hadley.nz](https://r4ds.hadley.nz)
5. **Ask me** — that's what I'm here for!

## Reading help pages

```{r}
?mean
```

Help pages include:

- **Description** — what the function does
- **Usage** — how to call it
- **Arguments** — what inputs it takes
- **Examples** — working code you can run

The examples section is gold — run them!

## Error messages

Errors will happen. A lot. That's normal.

```{r}
#| error: true
#| eval: true
# This will error - can you spot why?
maen(c(1, 2, 3))
```

. . .

Read the error message carefully — R is trying to help you.

- [R4DS Ch 6: Workflow: scripts and projects](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/workflow-scripts)

✅ **Do:**

- Install R and RStudio
- Create your psy410 project
- Install the tidyverse package
- Poke around! Try things! Break stuff!

## Key takeaways

1. **R is a tool** — like learning any tool, it takes practice
2. **RStudio makes R usable** — learn the interface
3. **Projects keep you organized** — always use them
4. **Scripts save your work** — never just type in the console
5. **Errors are learning opportunities** — read them, Google them
