title: "Final Project"
---

## Overview

The final project is your chance to apply everything you've learned in this course to a dataset that interests you. You'll choose a dataset, develop research questions, explore the data with visualizations, and communicate your findings in a polished Quarto report.

**Weight:** 35% of your final grade.

## What you'll produce

By the end of the quarter, you'll have:

- A **dataset** relevant to psychology or the social sciences
- **2-3 research questions** that can be explored through visualization
- A **polished Quarto report** (`.qmd` rendered to HTML) with 4-6 publication-ready figures
- A **5-minute recorded video** presenting your key findings (shared with the class)

## Milestones

The project is broken into four milestones so you get feedback along the way:

| Milestone | Due Date | What you submit |
|-----------|----------|-----------------|
| [Proposal](01-proposal.qmd) | Wed Apr 29 (Session 10) | Dataset, research questions, initial plan |
| [Draft](02-draft.qmd) | Wed May 20 (Session 15) | Working code, preliminary visualizations |
| [Final Report](03-final-report.qmd) | Wed Jun 3 (Session 18) | Complete Quarto report |
| [Presentation](04-presentation.qmd) | Finals Week | 5-minute recorded video |

## Grading breakdown

| Component | Points |
|-----------|--------|
| Proposal | 10 |
| Draft | 15 |
| Final Report | 60 |
| Presentation | 15 |
| **Total** | **100** |

## Choosing a dataset

Your dataset should:

- Be relevant to **psychology or the social sciences** (broadly defined)
- Have at least **100 observations** and **5 variables** (ideally a mix of numeric and categorical)
- Be something you find **genuinely interesting** — you'll spend several weeks with it

### Good sources for datasets

- **Open Science Framework (OSF):** [osf.io](https://osf.io) — published research datasets
- **ICPSR:** [icpsr.umich.edu](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/) — social science data archive
- **General Social Survey (GSS):** [gss.norc.org](https://gss.norc.org/)
- **World Values Survey:** [worldvaluessurvey.org](https://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/)
- **Kaggle:** [kaggle.com/datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) — search for psychology-related datasets
- **Your own research data** — with your advisor's permission

## Not sure where to start?
Come to office hours and we can browse datasets together. It's much easier to stay motivated when you're working with data you care about.

## AI tools policy

AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude, GitHub Copilot, etc.) are **not permitted** on the final project. All code, visualizations, and writing must be your own work. See the [syllabus](/syllabus.qmd#ai-tools-policy) for the full policy and rationale.

## Getting help

- **Office hours** are the best place to get feedback on your project
- **Class work time** in Sessions 17 and 18 is dedicated to project questions
- You're welcome to **discuss ideas with classmates**, but each person submits their own project
