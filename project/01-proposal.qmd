## Milestone Details
**Due:** Wednesday, April 29 before class (Session 10)
**Submit:** PDF or Word document on Canvas
**Points:** 10
:::

## Overview

The proposal is a short document that tells me what you plan to do for your final project. The goal is to make sure you have a viable dataset and clear questions *before* you invest hours of work. I'll give you feedback within a few days so you can adjust if needed.

## What to submit

Your proposal should be **1-2 pages** and include the following sections:

### 1. Dataset description

- What is the dataset? Where does it come from?
- How many observations and variables does it have?
- What do the key variables represent?
- Include a link to the dataset source or a description of how you obtained it

### 2. Research questions

Write **2-3 research questions** that you plan to explore through visualization. These don't need to be formal hypotheses — they're the questions that will guide your exploration.

Good research questions are:

- **Specific** enough to answer with the data you have
- **Visual** — they suggest a plot or comparison
- **Interesting** — they have a "so what?" answer

## Examples of good research questions

- "Do anxiety levels differ by gender and age group?"
- "Is there a relationship between social media use and well-being, and does it depend on the type of platform?"
- "How do response times change across experimental conditions and trial blocks?"
:::

### 3. Visualization plan

For each research question, briefly describe what type of plot you think would be appropriate:

- What variables will be on each axis?
- What geom(s) might you use?
- Will you need to facet or use color to show groups?

This doesn't need to be final — it's a starting plan that will evolve.

### 4. Justification

Write **1 paragraph** explaining why this dataset and these questions are interesting to you. What do you hope to learn? How does it connect to psychology?

## How this will be graded

| Component | Points |
|-----------|--------|
| Dataset description (clear, complete, viable) | 3 |
| Research questions (specific, visual, interesting) | 3 |
| Visualization plan (reasonable match of plot type to question) | 2 |
| Justification (thoughtful, shows genuine interest) | 2 |
| **Total** | **10** |

## I need to approve your dataset
If your dataset has issues (too small, too messy, not enough variables), I'll let you know and we'll find a solution together. That's the whole point of this milestone — getting feedback early.
