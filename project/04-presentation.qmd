## Milestone Details
**Due:** Finals Week (exact date/time TBD based on finals schedule)
**Format:** 5-minute in-class presentation
**Points:** 15
:::

## Overview

The presentation is a brief share-out where you tell the class about your project. The goal is to practice communicating data findings to a general audience — a skill that's valuable whether you go into research, industry, or any field that uses data.

This is **not** a formal academic talk. Think of it as showing a friend something cool you found in your data.

## Format

- **5 minutes** — I will time you; practice beforehand so you don't run over
- **2-3 slides or figures** — you don't need a full slide deck; screen-sharing your report and walking through key figures is fine
- **Brief Q&A** — the class may ask 1-2 questions

## What to cover

### 1. The setup (about 1 minute)

- What is your dataset?
- What question(s) were you trying to answer?
- Keep this brief — the figures are the star of the show

### 2. Your key findings (about 3 minutes)

- Walk the audience through **2-3 of your best visualizations**
- For each figure, explain:
  - What it shows (read the plot for the audience)
  - What the takeaway is (the "so what?")
- Use the storytelling principles from Session 15: lead with the finding, not the method

### 3. One reflection (about 1 minute)

Share **one** of the following:

- Something surprising you discovered
- A challenge you overcame
- Something you'd do differently next time
- What you're most proud of

## Tips for a great presentation

- **Practice out loud** — 5 minutes goes fast
- **Don't read from a script** — know your figures well enough to talk about them naturally
- **Make your figures legible** — increase font sizes if needed; the back of the room needs to see too
- **Tell a story** — start with the question, show the answer, explain why it matters
- **It's okay to show something that didn't work** — failed analyses and dead ends are part of data science

## How this will be graded

| Component | Points |
|-----------|--------|
| Clear introduction of dataset and questions | 3 |
| Figures are well-chosen and clearly explained | 5 |
| Narrative is engaging and easy to follow | 3 |
| Reflection shows genuine thought | 2 |
| Stayed within time limit | 2 |
| **Total** | **15** |
