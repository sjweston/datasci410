## Milestone Details
**Due:** Wednesday, May 20 before class (Session 15)
**Submit:** `.R` script or `.qmd` file + any output files, on Canvas
**Points:** 15
:::

## Overview

The draft is a working checkpoint — it shows that you can import and clean your data, and that you've started exploring your research questions with visualizations. It does **not** need to be polished. Think of it as showing your work-in-progress so I can give you feedback before the final push.

## What to submit

### 1. Working code

Your script or Quarto document should:

- **Import** your dataset (using `read_csv()`, `read_excel()`, or similar)
- **Clean** the data as needed (handle column types, missing value codes, variable names)
- **Tidy** the data if necessary (pivot, separate, etc.)
- **Run without errors** from a fresh R session

::: {.callout-tip}
## Test this before submitting
Restart R (Session → Restart R), then run your entire script from top to bottom. If it breaks, fix it before submitting.

### 2. At least 2 preliminary visualizations

Create at least **2 plots** that start to address your research questions. These don't need to be publication-ready — they're exploratory. But they should:

- Use appropriate geoms for the data type
- Have labeled axes and a title
- Show something meaningful (not just `geom_point(aes(x, y))` with no context)

### 3. Bullet-point outline of findings

After your code, include a brief section (in comments or markdown) with:

- What patterns or trends do you see so far?
- Were there any surprises?
- Did your research questions change based on what you found?

### 4. List of remaining tasks

What still needs to be done? Be specific:

- Which visualizations do you still need to create?
- What cleaning or tidying remains?
- Are there any problems you're stuck on?

This helps me give you targeted feedback.

## How this will be graded

| Component | Points |
|-----------|--------|
| Working code (imports, cleans, runs without errors) | 5 |
| Preliminary visualizations (at least 2, appropriate choices) | 5 |
| Outline of findings (thoughtful, shows engagement with data) | 3 |
| Remaining tasks (specific, realistic plan for completion) | 2 |
| **Total** | **15** |

## This is a checkpoint, not a final product
I'm not expecting polish here. I'm looking for evidence that you've made real progress and have a clear path to the finish line. If you're struggling, this is the time to ask for help — not Week 10.
