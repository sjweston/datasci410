::: {.callout-note}
## Milestone Details
**Due:** Wednesday, June 3 before class (Session 18)
**Submit:** `.qmd` file + rendered `.html` file on Canvas
**Points:** 60
:::

## Overview

The final report is the culmination of your project. It's a polished, reproducible Quarto document that imports your data, explores your research questions through visualizations, and tells a clear story about what you found. This is meant to be something you could show to a future employer, a graduate admissions committee, or a research advisor.

## What to submit

Submit **two files** on Canvas:

1. Your **Quarto source file** (`.qmd`)
2. The **rendered HTML output** (`.html`)

Your `.qmd` file must render cleanly from a fresh R session. I will re-render it to verify.

## Report structure

Your report should include the following sections:

### 1. Introduction

- What is your dataset? Where does it come from?
- What research questions are you exploring?
- Why are these questions interesting or important?

**Length:** 2-3 paragraphs.

### 2. Data description

- How many observations and variables?
- What are the key variables and what do they represent?
- Describe any cleaning or tidying steps you performed (and why)
- Include a summary table of descriptive statistics using `knitr::kable()`

### 3. Results

This is the core of your report. For each research question:

- Present **1-2 polished visualizations** that address the question
- Write **1-2 paragraphs** interpreting what the figure shows
- Use **inline code** to report key numbers (means, counts, etc.) — never hard-code statistics

Your report should include **4-6 publication-ready figures** total. Each figure should:

- Use an appropriate geom for the data type
- Have a clear, informative title (tells the reader *what to see*, not just what the axes are)
- Have labeled axes with units where appropriate
- Use a clean theme (`theme_minimal()`, `theme_classic()`, etc.)
- Use a colorblind-friendly palette when color is meaningful
- Include a caption (using `#| fig-cap`)

### 4. Discussion

- What did you learn from your data?
- Were there any surprises or unexpected findings?
- What are the limitations of your analysis?
- What would you do next if you had more time?

**Length:** 2-3 paragraphs.

### 5. Process documentation

- Did you use AI tools? If so, which ones and for what?
- What did the AI get right? What did it get wrong?
- What was the most challenging part of this project?
- What are you most proud of?

**Length:** 1-2 paragraphs.

## Technical requirements

- [ ] Report renders to HTML without errors from a fresh R session
- [ ] All packages are loaded in a single setup chunk with `#| include: false`
- [ ] Data is imported using a relative path (not an absolute path like `C:/Users/...`)
- [ ] Summary statistics are reported with inline code (not hard-coded numbers)
- [ ] Figures include captions using `#| fig-cap`
- [ ] Code is organized, commented, and uses the pipe operator where appropriate
- [ ] YAML header includes your name, a title, and the date

## How this will be graded

| Component | Points |
|-----------|--------|
| **Introduction** — clear, well-motivated | 5 |
| **Data description** — complete, includes summary table | 5 |
| **Visualizations** — 4-6 figures, polished, appropriate | 20 |
| **Narrative** — interpretation is clear, connected to questions | 10 |
| **Discussion** — thoughtful reflection on findings and limitations | 5 |
| **Process documentation** — honest, reflective | 5 |
| **Reproducibility** — renders cleanly, inline code, relative paths | 5 |
| **Code quality** — organized, readable, well-commented | 5 |
| **Total** | **60** |

## What makes an A-level report?

An excellent report doesn't just show data — it tells a **story**. The figures are chosen deliberately to answer specific questions, the narrative guides the reader through your findings, and the whole document feels like a coherent piece of work (not a collection of disconnected plots). Review the storytelling principles from Session 15 as you finalize your report.
