## Overview

Weekly coding assignments reinforce what you learn in each session. They're designed to take 1-2 hours outside of class, and you'll have time during class to get started and ask questions.

**Grading:** 8 assignments total, lowest 1 dropped. Worth 35% of your final grade.

## Submission Guidelines

- Submit all assignments through **Canvas** before class on the due date
- Submit your `.R` script or `.qmd` file (depending on the assignment)
- Include your name and the assignment number at the top of your file
- Make sure your code runs without errors from a fresh R session

## AI Tools Policy

Weekly assignments are **AI-permitted with documentation**. You may use tools like ChatGPT or GitHub Copilot, but you must:

1. **Cite your use** — Note which tool and for what purpose
2. **Document the process** — Briefly reflect on what it got right/wrong
3. **Understand your code** — Be prepared to explain it verbally

See the [syllabus](/syllabus.qmd#ai-tools-policy) for the full policy.
