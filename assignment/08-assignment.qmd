## Assignment Details
**Assigned:** Wednesday, May 27 (Session 16)
**Due:** Monday, June 1 before class
**Submit:** Quarto document (`.qmd`) AND rendered HTML on Canvas
:::

## Overview

This assignment brings together everything you've learned. You'll create a complete, reproducible Quarto report that imports data, conducts analysis, and presents findings with narrative text.

## The Task

Create a Quarto document that analyzes a dataset and tells a clear story. Your report should be something you'd be proud to share with a colleague or include in a portfolio.

## Dataset Options

Choose ONE of the following:

1. **`palmerpenguins::penguins`** — Penguin measurements from Antarctica
2. **`psych::bfi`** — Big Five personality inventory
3. **`nycflights13::flights`** — NYC flight data (subset to a specific month/carrier)
4. **Your final project dataset** — Get a head start on your project!

## Required Elements

Your Quarto document must include:

### 1. YAML Header (5 points)

```yaml
---
title: "Your Descriptive Title"
author: "Your Name"
date: today
format:
  html:
    toc: true
    code-fold: true
---
```

### 2. Introduction (10 points)

- Brief description of the dataset
- Your research question(s)
- Why this is interesting

### 3. Data Import & Cleaning (15 points)

- Load necessary packages
- Import/load the data
- Any cleaning or transformation needed
- Use code chunks with appropriate options

### 4. Exploratory Analysis (25 points)

- At least 2 visualizations exploring your data
- Appropriate use of ggplot2 features (labels, themes, etc.)
- Brief interpretation of each visualization

### 5. Main Analysis (25 points)

- Address your research question(s)
- At least 1 publication-quality figure
- Summary statistics presented clearly (consider using `knitr::kable()` for tables)

### 6. Inline Code (10 points)

Use inline R code to report at least 3 statistics in your narrative text.

Example:
```markdown
The dataset contains `r nrow(data)` observations...
```

### 7. Conclusion (10 points)

- Summary of key findings
- Limitations or caveats
- What you would explore next

## Formatting Requirements

- Use appropriate headers to organize your document
- Include alt-text for figures (accessibility)
- Code should be visible but foldable (`code-fold: true`)
- Document should render without errors

## Reproducibility Check

Before submitting:

1. Restart R (Session → Restart R)
2. Render your document from scratch
3. Verify all code runs and output appears correctly

## Grading Rubric

| Component | Points |
|-----------|--------|
| YAML header correct | 5 |
| Introduction clear and complete | 10 |
| Data import/cleaning well-documented | 15 |
| Exploratory visualizations | 25 |
| Main analysis addresses question | 25 |
| Inline code used effectively | 10 |
| Conclusion thoughtful | 10 |
| **Total** | **100** |

**Bonus (up to 5 points):** Exceptional visualization design, creative analysis, or going beyond requirements.

## Submission

Submit both files on Canvas:

- [ ] Your `.qmd` source file
- [ ] The rendered `.html` file

Both files are required! The `.qmd` shows your code, the `.html` shows it runs correctly.

## Tips for Success

- Start with an outline before coding
- Write narrative as you go, not at the end
- Test each code chunk as you write it
- Keep visualizations simple and clear
- Have a friend review your report — does it make sense to someone who hasn't seen your code?

This assignment is excellent preparation for your final project!
