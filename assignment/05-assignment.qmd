## Overview

This assignment practices exploratory data analysis (EDA). You'll explore distributions, identify outliers, investigate relationships, and generate questions from data. This is also good practice for your final project!

## Setup

```r
# Assignment 5: Exploratory Data Analysis
# Your Name
# Date

library(tidyverse)
library(psych)  # For the bfi dataset

# If you haven't installed psych:
# install.packages("psych")
```

## The Dataset

We'll use the Big Five Inventory (BFI) dataset from the `psych` package:

```r
data(bfi)
bfi <- as_tibble(bfi)
glimpse(bfi)
```

This contains responses from 2,800 participants on 25 personality items (5 per Big Five trait: Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Neuroticism, Openness), plus age, gender, and education.

## Part 1: Exploring Distributions (30 points)

### Task 1.1
Create histograms for age and at least one personality item. What do you notice about the distributions?

### Task 1.2
Are there any outliers or unusual values in age? How would you identify them programmatically? (Hint: consider values beyond 3 standard deviations, or use `filter()` with reasonable bounds)

### Task 1.3
How much missing data is there? Create a summary showing the percentage of NA values for each variable.

## Part 2: Exploring Relationships (35 points)

### Task 2.1
Create a scatterplot of two personality items that you hypothesize might be related. Add a trend line. Was your hypothesis supported?

### Task 2.2
Create boxplots showing how one personality item differs by gender. Do you see a difference?

### Task 2.3
Create a correlation matrix visualization for the 5 Extraversion items (E1-E5).

Hint:
```r
bfi |>
  select(E1:E5) |>
  cor(use = "complete.obs") |>
  # then visualize...
```

What do you notice? (Some items may be reverse-coded!)

## Part 3: Generating Questions (20 points)

### Task 3.1
Based on your exploration, generate **3 interesting questions** that could be investigated with this data. Write them as comments.

### Task 3.2
For **one** of your questions, create a visualization that helps answer it. Explain your findings in a comment.

## Part 4: EDA Report (15 points)

Write a 1-page (approximately 300-400 words) EDA report summarizing:

1. **The data:** Brief description of the dataset
2. **Key findings:** 2-3 interesting patterns you discovered
3. **Data quality issues:** Missing data, outliers, or concerns
4. **Next steps:** What would you investigate further?

Save this as a PDF (you can write it in Word, Google Docs, or even as comments in R and knit to PDF).

## Submission

Submit:

- [ ] Your `.R` script with all code and comments
- [ ] 1-page EDA report as PDF

Make sure your script runs without errors.
