## Overview

This assignment focuses on creating publication-quality visualizations. You'll practice using different geoms, scales, themes, and design principles.

## Setup

```r
# Assignment 4: Visualization Deep Dive
# Your Name
# Date

library(tidyverse)
```

## Part 1: Bar Charts with Error Bars (30 points)

Use the `palmerpenguins` dataset:

```r
# install.packages("palmerpenguins")
library(palmerpenguins)
```

### Task 1.1
Create a summary table showing mean flipper length by species, including standard error.

```r
# Hint: SE = sd / sqrt(n)
```

### Task 1.2
Create a bar chart showing mean flipper length by species with error bars representing ±1 SE.

Your plot should:

- Have clear axis labels (not variable names)
- Use a clean theme
- Have a descriptive title
- Use a colorblind-friendly palette (hint: `scale_fill_viridis_d()`)

## Part 2: Distributions (25 points)

### Task 2.1
Create a histogram of penguin body mass. Experiment with different bin widths. In a comment, explain what bin width you chose and why.

### Task 2.2
Create overlapping density plots of body mass, colored by species. Set transparency so all distributions are visible.

### Task 2.3
Create a boxplot of body mass by species. Then recreate it as a violin plot. In a comment, discuss what each shows that the other doesn't.

## Part 3: The "Bad" and "Good" Graph (30 points)

Using any dataset of your choice (`mpg`, `penguins`, `diamonds`, etc.):

### Task 3.1: The Bad Graph
Create an intentionally bad visualization that violates at least 4 design principles. In comments, list what makes it bad.

Examples of "bad" choices:

- 3D effects
- Pie chart with many categories
- Rainbow color scheme
- Missing labels
- Misleading axis
- Excessive chartjunk

### Task 3.2: The Good Graph
Create a good version of the same data. In comments, explain your design choices.

## Part 4: Recreate a Figure (15 points)

Using the provided image on Canvas, recreate the figure as closely as possible. Pay attention to:

- Geom type
- Colors
- Labels
- Theme elements

You won't match it exactly, but get as close as you can.

## Submission

Submit:

- [ ] Your `.R` script with all code and comments
- [ ] `good_graph.png` — your good visualization from Part 3
- [ ] `bad_graph.png` — your bad visualization from Part 3

Make sure your script runs without errors and all files are saved correctly.
