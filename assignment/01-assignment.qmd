**Due:** Monday, April 6 before class
**Submit:** R script (`.R` file) on Canvas

## Overview

This assignment gets you comfortable with RStudio and introduces you to creating visualizations with ggplot2. You'll work with the built-in `mpg` dataset to create your first plots.

## Setup

1. Open RStudio and your `psy410` project
2. Create a new R script: File → New File → R Script
3. Save it as `assignment-01-YOURNAME.R`
4. At the top of your script, add:

```r
# Assignment 1: Getting Started with R
# Your Name
# Date

library(tidyverse)
```

## Tasks

### Task 1: Explore the data (10 points)

Use the `mpg` dataset (loaded automatically with tidyverse).

a) Use `glimpse()` to look at the structure of `mpg`. In a comment, note how many rows and columns there are.

b) Use `?mpg` to read the documentation. In a comment, explain what `displ` and `hwy` represent.

### Task 2: Create a basic scatterplot (20 points)

Create a scatterplot showing the relationship between engine displacement (`displ`) and highway fuel efficiency (`hwy`).

Your plot should:

- Have displacement on the x-axis
- Have highway mpg on the y-axis
- Include a clear title
- Have labeled axes (not just variable names)

### Task 3: Add color (20 points)

Modify your scatterplot to color the points by vehicle class (`class`).

- The legend should appear automatically
- Give the legend a clear title (hint: use `labs()`)

### Task 4: Create faceted plots (25 points)

Create the same scatterplot (displacement vs highway mpg, colored by class), but now faceted by drive type (`drv`).

- Use `facet_wrap()`
- Each panel should be clearly labeled

### Task 5: Save your plot (15 points)

Save your final faceted plot as a PNG file.

```r
ggsave("mpg_faceted_plot.png", width = 10, height = 6)
```

Verify the file was created in your project folder.

### Task 6: Reflection (10 points)

At the bottom of your script, answer these questions in comments:

```r
# Reflection Questions:
# 1. What relationship do you observe between engine size and fuel efficiency?
# 2. Do all vehicle classes follow the same pattern?
# 3. What was the most challenging part of this assignment?
```

## Submission Checklist

Before submitting, make sure:

- [ ] Your script runs without errors from start to finish
- [ ] All tasks are completed with code and comments
- [ ] Your PNG file was created successfully
- [ ] Your name is at the top of the script

Submit your `.R` file on Canvas.
