## During class

We'll cover:

- Why storytelling? Data + visuals + narrative = change
- The Knaflic framework:
  1. Understand the context — who is your audience?
  2. Choose appropriate visuals — match plot type to message
  3. Eliminate clutter — less is more
  4. Focus attention — use preattentive attributes strategically
  5. Think like a designer — visual hierarchy, accessibility
- Critical evaluation of figures:
  - Misleading figures — truncated axes, cherry-picked ranges, 3D charts
  - Boring figures — no title, too many colors, wrong plot type
  - The "so what?" test
- Applying storytelling to your final project

## After class

✅ **Practice:**

1. Pick one figure from your final project draft. Apply the "so what?" test — can you state the takeaway in one sentence?
2. Declutter that figure: remove unnecessary gridlines, legends, and default styling
3. Add a clear, informative title that tells the reader what to see (not just what the axes are)
4. Try `annotate()` to add a text label highlighting the key finding
5. Show your figure to someone who hasn't seen your data. Can they understand the point without explanation?

::: {.callout-note}
## The "so what?" test

Every figure should answer a question. If you can't complete this sentence, the figure needs work:

> "This figure shows that _______________."

If you find yourself saying "this figure shows the data," you haven't found the story yet. Dig deeper.

### Handout

The APA figure formatting guidelines handout is available in the course files. It covers journal-specific formatting conventions for reference — but remember, the core principles of good visualization apply everywhere.
