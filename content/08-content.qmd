## During class

We'll cover:

- Why perception matters — how the brain processes visual information
- Preattentive attributes: color, size, position, shape
- Gestalt principles and how they shape layout
- Color theory: sequential, diverging, and qualitative palettes
- Colorblind-friendly design (and why it matters)
- Decluttering: removing the visual noise
- Psychology-specific figures: error bars, interaction plots, raincloud plots
- Putting it all together with `theme()` customization

## After class

✅ **Practice:**

1. Take a plot you made earlier in the course. Identify 3 things that could be decluttered.
2. Recreate it using only `theme_minimal()` — what disappears? What stays?
3. Try switching your color palette to `scale_fill_viridis_d()`. Does it change the story?
4. Create a raincloud plot (violin + boxplot + jitter) for any grouped data you have
5. Make a "bad" version of a figure on purpose — violate as many design principles as you can. Then fix it.

## The decluttering checklist

Before you call a figure "done," ask:

- Is the background gray? → Switch to `theme_minimal()` or `theme_classic()`
- Are there gridlines? → Remove them
- Is there a legend when there's only one group? → Remove it
- Do the axis labels say something meaningful? → If not, rename them
- Can someone understand the point without reading the caption? → If not, the title needs work

### Colorblind-friendly palettes

```r
# Viridis — works for continuous and discrete
scale_fill_viridis_d()   # discrete categories
scale_fill_viridis_c()   # continuous values

# ColorBrewer — curated palettes
scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set2")      # qualitative
scale_fill_brewer(palette = "RdBu")      # diverging
scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Blues")     # sequential
```

These are all built into ggplot2 — no extra packages needed.
