## Before class

📖 **Reading:**

- [R4DS Ch 10: Exploratory data analysis](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/eda) (sections 10.5–10.6)

## During class

We'll cover:

- Exploring covariation — relationships between variables
- Categorical + continuous: boxplots, violin plots, `geom_freqpoly()` with color
- Categorical + categorical: `geom_count()`, `geom_tile()` with counts
- Continuous + continuous: scatterplots and trend lines
- Dealing with overplotting: alpha, jitter, binning
- Patterns, models, and the correlation vs. causation reminder
- Hands-on: Explore a real psychology dataset

## After class

✅ **Practice:**

Using the `bfi` dataset from the `psych` package:

1. Pick two personality items (e.g., `E1` and `A1`). Make a scatterplot — is there a relationship?
2. Create boxplots of `age` grouped by `education`. What patterns do you see?
3. Use `geom_count()` to visualize the relationship between `education` and `gender`
4. Try adding `alpha = 0.3` to a crowded scatterplot. Does it help?
5. Calculate the correlation between two continuous variables using `cor(x, y, use = "complete.obs")`

::: {.callout-note}
## Correlation vs. causation

Finding a relationship between two variables does **not** mean one causes the other. Always ask:

- Could there be a confounding variable?
- Does the direction of causation make sense?
- Is this a meaningful effect or just a large sample?

In psychology, this distinction is critical — observational data can suggest hypotheses but rarely prove causation.

### Overplotting solutions

```r
# Too many points? Try these:

# 1. Transparency
ggplot(data, aes(x, y)) + geom_point(alpha = 0.3)

# 2. Jitter (adds random noise)
ggplot(data, aes(x, y)) + geom_jitter(width = 0.2, height = 0.2)

# 3. 2D binning (heatmap-style)
ggplot(data, aes(x, y)) + geom_bin2d()
```
