## Before class

📖 **Reading:**

- [R4DS Ch 18: Missing values](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/missing-values)

## During class

We'll cover:

- Why missing data matters in psychology — attrition, non-response, skip patterns
- Explicit vs. implicit missing values
- Counting and exploring missingness patterns
- `drop_na()` — complete case analysis (listwise deletion)
- `replace_na()` — filling in known values
- `fill()` — carrying values forward/backward
- `complete()` — making implicit missing values explicit
- When **not** to fill — don't make up data!
- Brief mention: multiple imputation exists (beyond this course)

## After class

✅ **Practice:**

1. Count the number of `NA`s in each column of a dataset using `summarize(across(everything(), ~sum(is.na(.x))))`
2. Use `drop_na()` on a specific column vs. the whole dataset — what's the difference in rows lost?
3. Try `replace_na()` to fill missing values with a sensible default (e.g., 0 for "no response")
4. Use `complete()` to make implicit missing values explicit in a longitudinal dataset
5. Think critically: when is it okay to drop missing data? When is it dangerous?

::: {.callout-note}
## Missing data is information

Missing values aren't just annoying — they can tell you something. Before dropping or filling `NA`s, ask:

- **Why** is this value missing? (Didn't answer? Wasn't asked? Data entry error?)
- **Is the missingness random?** If participants who dropped out were systematically different, dropping them biases your results
- **How much is missing?** A few values vs. 40% of a column require different strategies

Document your decisions about missing data — your future self (and reviewers) will thank you.

### Counting missing values

```r
# Quick summary of missingness across all columns
data |>
  summarize(
    across(everything(), ~sum(is.na(.x)))
  ) |>
  pivot_longer(everything(),
    names_to = "variable",
    values_to = "n_missing"
  ) |>
  arrange(desc(n_missing))
```
