## Before class

No new reading today — focus on finishing your final project report!

::: {.callout-important}
## Final Project Report is due today
Submit your complete Quarto report with visualizations before class.
:::

## During class

We'll cover:

- The complete data science workflow (review):
  Import → Tidy → Transform → Visualize → Communicate
- Live demonstration: a real psychology analysis from start to finish
- What you've learned — celebrating how far you've come
- Where to go from here:
  - Statistics in R (t-tests, ANOVA, regression)
  - Advanced R (functions, iteration, packages)
  - Version control (Git and GitHub)
  - Interactive visualizations (Shiny)
  - Machine learning (tidymodels)
- Resources for continued learning
- Final project work time and Q&A

```

## After class

✅ **What's next:**

1. **Prepare your presentation** — 5 minutes, focus on your key finding and one or two polished figures
2. Practice explaining your work to someone outside the class. Can they follow your story?
3. Finalize your Quarto report — make sure it renders cleanly from scratch

### The skills you've built

```r
# You started here:
1 + 1

# Now you can do this:
raw_data |>
  read_csv() |>
  pivot_longer(cols = starts_with("time"),
               names_to = "timepoint",
               values_to = "score") |>
  left_join(demographics, by = "participant_id") |>
  group_by(condition, timepoint) |>
  summarize(M = mean(score, na.rm = TRUE),
            SE = sd(score, na.rm = TRUE) / sqrt(n())) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = timepoint, y = M, fill = condition)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = M - SE, ymax = M + SE),
                position = position_dodge(0.9), width = 0.2) +
  scale_fill_viridis_d() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Score improvement across conditions",
       y = "Mean score", x = "Timepoint")
```

That's a real accomplishment. Be proud of it.
