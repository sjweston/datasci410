## Before class

📖 **Reading:**

- [R4DS Ch 10: Exploratory data analysis](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/eda) (sections 10.1–10.4)

::: {.callout-important}
## Assignment 4 is due today
[Assignment 4: Visualization Deep Dive](/assignment/04-assignment.qmd) — submit before class.

## During class

We'll cover:

- What is EDA? Exploratory vs. confirmatory thinking
- The EDA mindset — curiosity, not confirmation
- Exploring distributions: histograms, density plots, bar charts
- Choosing binwidth and when it matters
- Spotting outliers visually and programmatically
- What to do with outliers (investigate, don't delete)
- A first look at missing data
- Putting it all together: a systematic EDA workflow

## After class

✅ **Practice:**

Using the `bfi` dataset from the `psych` package (loaded in class today):

1. Explore the distribution of `age`. What shape is it? Is it skewed?
2. Check for outliers in `age` using both a histogram and a boxplot. Are any values suspicious?
3. Pick 3 personality items (e.g., `E1`, `N2`, `A4`) and plot their distributions. What do you notice?
4. Count how many missing values each variable has. Which variables have the most?
5. Write down 2–3 questions that your exploration makes you want to answer

## The EDA loop

EDA isn't a linear checklist — it's a cycle:

1. **Ask** a question
2. **Visualize** the data to answer it
3. **Notice** something new
4. **Ask** another question
5. Repeat

There's no "finished." The goal is understanding, not a final answer.

### Loading the dataset

```r
library(psych)
data(bfi)
bfi <- as_tibble(bfi)   # Convert to tibble for tidyverse compatibility
```

### Outlier investigation template

```r
# Quick outlier check for any numeric variable
variable_name <- "age"

bfi |>
  summarize(
    min = min(!!sym(variable_name), na.rm = TRUE),
    max = max(!!sym(variable_name), na.rm = TRUE),
    mean = mean(!!sym(variable_name), na.rm = TRUE),
    sd = sd(!!sym(variable_name), na.rm = TRUE)
  )

# Flag values beyond 3 SD from the mean
bfi |>
  filter(abs(age - mean(age, na.rm = TRUE)) > 3 * sd(age, na.rm = TRUE))
```
