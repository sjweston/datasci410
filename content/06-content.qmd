## Before class

📖 **Readings:**

- [R4DS Ch 7: Data import](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/data-import)
- [R4DS Ch 20: Spreadsheets](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/spreadsheets)

## During class

We'll cover:

- The data science workflow: where import fits in
- `read_csv()` — reading CSV files and handling common problems
- Column types and how to fix them when R guesses wrong
- Missing value codes (`-999`, `"N/A"`, etc.)
- `readxl::read_excel()` — working with Excel files
- A quick look at SPSS files with `haven::read_sav()`
- Practical tips for importing Qualtrics exports

## After class

✅ **Practice:**

1. Find a CSV file on your computer (or download one) and import it with `read_csv()`. Run `glimpse()` — do the types look right?
2. Check `problems()` after importing. Does it flag anything?
3. Try reading the messy CSV we created in class. Clean up the column names and missing values.
4. If you have an Excel file handy, try `read_excel()`. What happens with multiple sheets?

## Qualtrics import cheat sheet

Most Qualtrics CSV exports have two extra description rows after the header. The standard fix:

```r
qualtrics_data <- read_csv("my_export.csv",
  skip = 2,
  na = c("", "N/A", "-999")
)
```

Always `glimpse()` right after — Qualtrics column names are ugly but fixable with `rename()`.

### Package check

If you haven't already, make sure `readxl` is installed:

```r
install.packages("readxl")
```

It's not part of tidyverse, but it is part of the broader tidyverse ecosystem — `library(tidyverse)` does *not* load it automatically.
