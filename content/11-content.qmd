## Before class

📖 **Readings:**

- [R4DS Ch 12: Logical vectors](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/logicals)
- [R4DS Ch 13: Numbers](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/numbers)

## Assignment 5 is due today
[Assignment 5: Exploratory Data Analysis](/assignment/05-assignment.qmd) — submit before class.
:::

## During class

We'll cover:

- Logical vectors — `TRUE`/`FALSE` and how to use them
- Comparisons and Boolean operations (`&`, `|`, `!`)
- `if_else()` and `case_when()` for conditional values
- Numbers — integer vs. double, rounding, summarizing
- Handling `NA` in calculations with `na.rm = TRUE`
- Practical application: computing scale scores in psychology data

## After class

✅ **Practice:**

1. Use `if_else()` to create a new column that labels participants as "young" (under 25) or "older" (25+)
2. Use `case_when()` to recode a Likert scale (1 = "Strongly Disagree", 2 = "Disagree", etc.)
3. Calculate scale scores by averaging across items — remember `na.rm = TRUE`
4. Use `any()` and `all()` to check if any/all values in a column meet a condition
5. Practice rounding with `round()`, `floor()`, and `ceiling()` — when would you use each?

::: {.callout-note}
## case_when() is your friend

`case_when()` is the tidyverse version of "if... else if... else." It's especially useful for recoding variables:

```r
data |>
  mutate(
    age_group = case_when(
      age < 18 ~ "Minor",
      age < 25 ~ "Young adult",
      age < 65 ~ "Adult",
      .default = "Senior"
    )
  )
```

The `.default` argument catches everything that doesn't match a previous condition.

### Psychology application: scale scores

```r
# Computing a scale score from individual items
survey_data |>
  mutate(
    # Reverse code item 3 (on a 1-5 scale)
    item3_r = 6 - item3,
    # Calculate mean score across items
    scale_score = rowMeans(
      pick(item1, item2, item3_r, item4, item5),
      na.rm = TRUE
    )
  )
```
