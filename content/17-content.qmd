## During class

We'll cover:

- From eyeballing to numbers: why we need correlation and regression
- Correlation with `cor()` and `cor.test()`
  - Pearson's *r* — what it is and what it isn't
  - Correlation matrices and heatmaps
  - **Correlation ≠ causation** (with psychology examples)
- Simple linear regression with `lm()`
  - Interpreting slope, intercept, and R²
  - Scatterplots with `geom_smooth(method = "lm")`
- Tidying model output with `broom::tidy()` and `broom::glance()`

## After class

✅ **Practice:**

1. Pick two numeric variables in a dataset you've been working with (or use `palmerpenguins::penguins`). Compute their correlation with `cor()` and `cor.test()`. Is the relationship what you expected?
2. Fit a simple linear model with `lm()`. Interpret the slope in plain language — what does a one-unit increase in *x* predict for *y*?
3. Use `broom::tidy()` to extract the model coefficients. Use `broom::glance()` to get the R². Report these with inline code in a Quarto document.
4. Create a scatterplot with `geom_smooth(method = "lm")`. Add informative labels and a title that tells the story.

## Correlation guidelines

- **|r| < 0.3** — weak
- **0.3 ≤ |r| < 0.7** — moderate
- **|r| ≥ 0.7** — strong

These are rough guidelines, not rigid cutoffs. Context and sample size matter.
