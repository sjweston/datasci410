## During class

We'll cover:

- Guided practice: a complete workflow from import to polished figure
  - Import a messy dataset
  - Clean and tidy
  - Explore and visualize
  - Create a polished figure
  - Document in Quarto
- Common errors and how to read them
  - "Object not found"
  - "Could not find function"
  - "Unexpected symbol"
  - "Non-numeric argument to binary operator"
- Debugging strategies
  - Read the error message (really read it)
  - Run code line by line
  - Google the error — everyone does this
  - Minimal reproducible examples
- Getting help effectively
- Q&A for final projects

## After class

✅ **Practice:**

1. Pick a dataset you haven't worked with before. Walk through the full workflow: import, glimpse, tidy, explore, visualize
2. Intentionally break your code in 3 different ways. Practice reading the error messages
3. Create a minimal reproducible example (reprex) for a problem you've encountered
4. Spend time polishing your final project — this is your last chance to ask questions!

## The debugging checklist

When your code doesn't work, go through this list:

1. **Read the error message** — it usually tells you exactly what's wrong
2. **Check spelling and capitalization** — R is case-sensitive
3. **Check your parentheses and pipes** — missing `)` or `|>` breaks everything
4. **Did you load the package?** — `library(tidyverse)` needs to run first
5. **Run code line by line** — find where it breaks
6. **Google the error** — someone has had this exact problem before
7. **Ask for help** — but bring a reprex!

### How to ask a good question

```r
# A good question includes:
# 1. What you're trying to do
# 2. What you expected to happen
# 3. What actually happened (the error message)
# 4. A minimal example that reproduces the problem

# Example reprex:
library(tidyverse)
data <- tibble(x = c(1, 2, "three"))
mean(data$x)
# Error: argument is not numeric or logical

# Question: "I'm trying to calculate the mean of a column,
# but one value is text. How do I handle this?"
```
