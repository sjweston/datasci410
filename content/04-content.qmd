## Before class

📖 **Readings:**

- [R4DS Ch 3: Data transformation](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/data-transform) (section 3.5)
- [R4DS Ch 4: Workflow: code style](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/workflow-style)

## During class

We'll cover:

- `group_by()` — define groups for operations
- `summarize()` — calculate summary statistics
- Combining `group_by()` + `summarize()` for grouped statistics
- `count()` — a quick shortcut for counting
- Code style best practices
- Building complete analysis pipelines

## After class

✅ **Practice:**

Using the `flights` dataset:

1. Calculate the average departure delay by carrier
2. Find which carrier has the most flights
3. Calculate the percentage of flights that were delayed (arr_delay > 0) by month
4. Find the top 5 destinations with the highest average arrival delay
5. Create a complete pipeline that filters, groups, summarizes, and arranges

## The power of group_by()

`group_by()` doesn't change how your data looks — it changes how other verbs work on it. Think of it as setting up the "behind the scenes" grouping structure.

```r
data |>
  group_by(condition) |>
  summarize(mean = mean(score))
```
:::

### Psychology application

```r
# Calculate descriptive statistics by condition
experiment_data |>
  group_by(condition) |>
  summarize(
    M = mean(score, na.rm = TRUE),
    SD = sd(score, na.rm = TRUE),
    n = n()
  )
```
