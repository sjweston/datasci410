You'll work with the built-in `mpg` dataset to create your first plots.\n\n## Setup\n\n1. Open RStudio and your `psy410` project\n2. Create a new R script: File → New File → R Script\n3. Save it as `assignment-01-YOURNAME.R`\n4. At the top of your script, add:\n\n```r\n# Assignment 1: Getting Started with R\n# Your Name\n# Date\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n```\n\n## Tasks\n\n### Task 1: Explore the data (10 points)\n\nUse the `mpg` dataset (loaded automatically with tidyverse).\n\na) Use `glimpse()` to look at the structure of `mpg`. In a comment, note how many rows and columns there are.\n\nb) Use `?mpg` to read the documentation. In a comment, explain what `displ` and `hwy` represent.\n\n### Task 2: Create a basic scatterplot (20 points)\n\nCreate a scatterplot showing the relationship between engine displacement (`displ`) and highway fuel efficiency (`hwy`).\n\nYour plot should:\n\n- Have displacement on the x-axis\n- Have highway mpg on the y-axis\n- Include a clear title\n- Have labeled axes (not just variable names)\n\n### Task 3: Add color (20 points)\n\nModify your scatterplot to color the points by vehicle class (`class`).\n\n- The legend should appear automatically\n- Give the legend a clear title (hint: use `labs()`)\n\n### Task 4: Create faceted plots (25 points)\n\nCreate the same scatterplot (displacement vs highway mpg, colored by class), but now faceted by drive type (`drv`).\n\n- Use `facet_wrap()`\n- Each panel should be clearly labeled\n\n### Task 5: Save your plot (15 points)\n\nSave your final faceted plot as a PNG file.\n\n```r\nggsave(\"mpg_faceted_plot.png\", width = 10, height = 6)\n```\n\nVerify the file was created in your project folder.\n\n### Task 6: Reflection (10 points)\n\nAt the bottom of your script, answer these questions in comments:\n\n```r\n# Reflection Questions:\n# 1. What relationship do you observe between engine size and fuel efficiency?\n# 2. Do all vehicle classes follow the same pattern?\n# 3. What was the most challenging part of this assignment?\n```\n\n## Submission Checklist\n\nBefore submitting, make sure:\n\n- [ ] Your script runs without errors from start to finish\n- [ ] All tasks are completed with code and comments\n- [ ] Your PNG file was created successfully\n- [ ] Your name is at the top of the script\n\nSubmit your `.R` file on Canvas.\n\n## Grading Rubric\n\n| Task | Points |\n|------|--------|\n| Task 1: Data exploration | 10 |\n| Task 2: Basic scatterplot | 20 |\n| Task 3: Color mapping | 20 |\n| Task 4: Faceting | 25 |\n| Task 5: Saving plot | 15 |\n| Task 6: Reflection | 10 |\n| **Total** | **100** |\n",
