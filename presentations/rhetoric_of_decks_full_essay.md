# The Rhetoric of Decks: A Theory of Sequential Persuasion in the Age of Artificial Intelligence

---

## I. What Is Rhetoric?

Rhetoric is not ornament. It is not flourish, embellishment, or the art of making weak arguments sound strong. That caricature—rhetoric as manipulation, as sophistry, as spin—reflects a corruption of the term that would have puzzled its earliest theorists.

Rhetoric, properly understood, is the study of how humans persuade one another. It asks: when communication succeeds, why does it succeed? When it fails, why does it fail? What makes one argument land and another fall flat, even when both are logically valid? These are not trivial questions. They sit at the intersection of psychology, epistemology, ethics, and aesthetics.

The field emerges as a formal discipline in classical Greece, but its crystallization into systematic theory owes primarily to one figure: Aristotle of Stagira.

### Aristotle and the Founding of Rhetoric

Aristotle (384–322 BCE) came to rhetoric somewhat unexpectedly. His primary intellectual commitments lay elsewhere—in metaphysics, ethics, biology, logic, politics. He studied under Plato at the Academy for twenty years, later tutored Alexander the Great, and eventually founded his own school, the Lyceum. His surviving corpus spans dozens of treatises across nearly every domain of inquiry. He is, by any measure, among the most influential thinkers in human history.

So why rhetoric? Why would a philosopher of such range turn his attention to persuasion?

The answer lies in Aristotle's intellectual project. Unlike Plato, who often treated rhetoric with suspicion—viewing it as a tool for manipulating the ignorant—Aristotle recognized that persuasion was inescapable in human affairs. Courts required advocates. Assemblies required deliberation. Citizens required the capacity to evaluate arguments. If persuasion was unavoidable, then it could be studied, systematized, and improved. Rhetoric was not the enemy of philosophy; it was its necessary complement.

In the *Rhetoric*, Aristotle defines his subject as "the faculty of observing in any given case the available means of persuasion." This is a capacious definition. It does not prescribe a single technique but rather opens an inquiry: what resources does a speaker have? How do they function? Under what conditions do they succeed?

His answer organized the field for millennia. Persuasion, Aristotle argued, operates through three modes:

**Ethos** (credibility): The audience asks, *why should I trust this speaker?* Ethos is established through demonstrated competence, apparent goodwill toward the audience, and moral character. It is not simply reputation brought to the speech but credibility constructed within it. A speaker who acknowledges uncertainty, who addresses counterarguments fairly, who demonstrates familiarity with the subject—this speaker earns trust through the performance itself.

**Pathos** (emotion): The audience asks, *why should I care?* Pathos recognizes that humans are not purely rational calculators. We are moved by fear, hope, anger, sympathy, pride, shame. Aristotle catalogs these emotions in detail, analyzing their causes and conditions. The point is not that emotions should override reason but that reason disconnected from emotion rarely motivates action. The speaker must make the audience *feel* the stakes.

**Logos** (argument): The audience asks, *does this make sense?* Logos encompasses the logical structure of the case—the evidence marshaled, the inferences drawn, the examples adduced. Aristotle distinguishes between formal demonstration (the province of logic proper) and rhetorical argument, which operates through enthymemes (compressed syllogisms that rely on audience beliefs) and examples (inductive generalizations). Logos is not everything, but without it, ethos and pathos become manipulation.

The Aristotelian framework is notable for its balance. It neither dismisses emotion as irrational nor treats logic as sufficient. It recognizes that persuasion is contextual—that audiences differ, occasions differ, subjects differ—and that the effective speaker calibrates to circumstance.

### Is Rhetoric Simply "A Way of Saying Things"?

One might object that this elevates something trivial. Isn't rhetoric just style? Just presentation? Just the packaging rather than the substance?

This objection misunderstands the nature of communication. There is no neutral transmission of ideas from one mind to another. Every act of communication involves selection (what to include, what to omit), arrangement (what order, what emphasis), and expression (what words, what tone, what medium). These choices are not incidental to meaning; they constitute it. The "same" argument presented differently is not, in fact, the same argument. It lands differently, persuades differently, is remembered differently.

Rhetoric is the systematic study of these choices and their effects. It is not opposed to substance but is rather the study of how substance becomes persuasive. To dismiss rhetoric as "mere" style is to misunderstand both rhetoric and style.

## II. A History of Rhetoricians After Aristotle

Aristotle established the field, but he did not complete it. Rhetoric continued to evolve through successive cultural contexts, each contributing new emphases and corrections.

### Cicero and the Roman Tradition

Marcus Tullius Cicero (106–43 BCE) adapted Greek rhetorical theory to Roman political and legal practice. His contributions were partly synthetic—he transmitted and organized Greek ideas—but also substantive. Cicero emphasized the education of the orator as a complete person: broadly learned, ethically grounded, practically experienced. For Cicero, rhetoric was inseparable from wisdom. The ideal orator was not a technician of persuasion but a statesman capable of moving citizens toward the good.

Cicero also elaborated the five canons of rhetoric that would structure rhetorical education for centuries:

1. **Invention** (*inventio*): discovering arguments
2. **Arrangement** (*dispositio*): organizing material
3. **Style** (*elocutio*): choosing words and figures
4. **Memory** (*memoria*): retaining the speech
5. **Delivery** (*pronuntiatio*): presenting through voice and gesture

This framework acknowledged that rhetoric was not merely composition but performance—a recognition that would become newly relevant two thousand years later.

### Quintilian and Pedagogy

Quintilian (35–100 CE), a Roman educator, produced the *Institutio Oratoria*, a comprehensive treatise on rhetorical education. His emphasis was pedagogical: how do you train speakers from childhood through maturity? Quintilian's influence extended through the medieval period into the Renaissance, shaping curricula and ideals of educated speech. He reinforced the connection between rhetoric and moral formation—the orator as *vir bonus dicendi peritus*, the good person skilled in speaking.

### Augustine and Sacred Rhetoric

Augustine of Hippo (354–430 CE) represents a crucial transformation. As a convert from Manichaeism to Christianity, Augustine brought his training in classical rhetoric to the service of theology. In *De Doctrina Christiana* (On Christian Teaching), he argued that Christians should not abandon rhetoric simply because pagans had developed it. Truth deserves eloquence. If falsehood is presented persuasively, truth should be no less so.

Augustine thus adapted Aristotelian and Ciceronian rhetoric for homiletics—the art of preaching. His contribution was to recognize that rhetoric serves ends beyond itself. The Christian preacher aims not merely to persuade but to illuminate, to convict, to transform. This teleological framing—rhetoric in service of transcendent purpose—would dominate medieval theory.

### Medieval and Renaissance Developments

Through the medieval period, rhetoric contracted in scope, often reduced to style and figures of speech while logic and dialectic claimed the argumentative terrain. The trivium—grammar, logic, rhetoric—placed rhetoric third, sometimes treating it as mere ornamentation.

The Renaissance recovered fuller classical sources and with them a richer conception of rhetoric. Humanists like Erasmus and Vives restored rhetoric's connection to civic life, ethical formation, and the full range of human persuasion. The printing press, meanwhile, began to transform the rhetorical situation in ways the ancients could not have anticipated.

### The Modern Period and Disciplinary Fragmentation

From the seventeenth century forward, rhetoric's terrain was progressively colonized by other disciplines. Logic became formal and mathematical. Psychology claimed the study of emotion and cognition. Literary criticism claimed style. Political science claimed deliberation. Rhetoric, as a unified field, fragmented.

Yet the core questions persisted. When the twentieth century saw renewed interest in rhetoric—through Kenneth Burke's dramatism, Chaim Perelman's "new rhetoric," and the emergence of composition studies—it was in part a recognition that no other discipline had adequately addressed the fundamental question: how does communication persuade?

## III. Technology and the Transformation of Persuasion

Rhetorical theory developed in a particular technological context: oral performance before live audiences. The orator stood before the assembly, the jury, the congregation. Success required memory, presence, voice, gesture. The audience was physically present, unable to pause, rewind, or skim.

Every subsequent technological shift has transformed the rhetorical situation, altering what is possible, what is expected, and what is effective.

### Literacy and the Written Word

The spread of literacy created audiences who could receive arguments in the speaker's absence. Writing permitted complexity impossible in oral performance—longer arguments, more intricate structures, precise quotation and citation. But it also eliminated the immediate feedback loop of live audience response. The writer must anticipate objections without seeing faces. Ethos must be established through text alone, without the charisma of presence.

### The Printing Press

Gutenberg's innovation (c. 1440) democratized textual reproduction, expanding potential audiences by orders of magnitude. Pamphlets, treatises, and eventually newspapers created publics that had never existed—readers who shared exposure to common texts without sharing physical space. This enabled new forms of political rhetoric (the pamphlet wars of the Reformation, the Federalist Papers) but also posed new challenges: how do you establish credibility with readers you will never meet?

### Mass Literacy and Universal Education

The nineteenth and twentieth centuries saw the progressive expansion of literacy to populations previously excluded: the working class, women, colonized peoples, racial minorities. Each expansion changed not just who could receive messages but who could produce them and what messages found audiences. The rhetorical landscape diversified.

### Radio and Television

Broadcasting introduced a paradox: mass intimacy. Franklin Roosevelt's fireside chats reached tens of millions, yet the medium created the impression of personal address. Television added visual presence, making appearance, gesture, and production values newly central. The Kennedy-Nixon debates of 1960 famously illustrated the medium's power: radio listeners thought Nixon won; television viewers favored Kennedy. Ethos became partly aesthetic.

### The Internet and Social Media

Digital networks collapsed barriers to publication while fragmenting audiences into niches. Everyone became a potential publisher; attention became the scarce resource. Rhetoric adapted: brevity increased, visual elements proliferated, engagement metrics created new feedback loops. The viral tweet, the TikTok video, the threaded argument—these are rhetorical forms with their own emerging conventions.

### And Then PowerPoint

Microsoft PowerPoint, released in 1987, is rarely discussed in histories of rhetoric. This is a curious omission.

PowerPoint and its analogues (Keynote, Google Slides, Beamer for LaTeX users, and now tools like Canva and Gamma) created a new presentational form: the slide deck. Within a generation, decks became ubiquitous in business, education, government, and military contexts. They structured how organizations think, decide, and communicate. By some estimates, hundreds of millions of presentations are given daily worldwide.

The slide deck is a hybrid medium. It combines elements of oral performance (a speaker, an audience, real-time delivery) with elements of document (persistent visual artifacts, potential for circulation). It imposes particular constraints: sequential structure, limited space per frame, the tension between visual and verbal channels. It enables particular affordances: rapid switching between evidence types, visual emphasis, the construction of narrative through sequencing.

And yet the theorization of this medium has been thin. There is Edward Tufte's famous critique—his essay "The Cognitive Style of PowerPoint" argues that the format actively degrades thought, reducing complex arguments to bullet points and encouraging "chartjunk." Tufte is not wrong that bad decks proliferate. But his critique does not amount to a rhetoric of decks. It tells us what not to do without fully explaining what makes a deck work when it works.

### Smartphones and Asynchronous Circulation

The final technological shift relevant here is the smartphone and cloud storage. Decks, initially conceived as accompaniments to live performance, increasingly circulate independently. They are emailed, linked, downloaded, studied in the speaker's absence. The 2007 NBER continuing education slides by Guido Imbens and Jeffrey Wooldridge on econometrics circulated for years via email, passed scholar to scholar, becoming pedagogical artifacts quite apart from their original delivery context.

This changes the rhetorical situation fundamentally. A deck designed solely to support live speech fails when read independently. A deck designed to function as a standalone document may be too text-heavy for live presentation. The modern deck-maker navigates this tension constantly.

### The Tools of Visual Quantification

A parallel technological development deserves attention: the tools that enable beautiful data visualization. The rise of statistical software with sophisticated graphics capabilities—R's ggplot2, Stata's twoway commands, Python's matplotlib and seaborn, LaTeX's TikZ for precise diagramming—has fundamentally changed what is possible on a slide.

These tools reflect deeper technological shifts: faster microprocessors, better graphics cards, higher-resolution displays, the democratization of design capabilities once reserved for specialists. A graduate student in 2024 can produce visualizations that would have required a professional graphics department in 1994.

This matters because data visualization is where logos becomes visible. A well-designed figure does not merely present numbers; it reveals pattern. It makes the argument perceptible. And with better tools, the floor for visual quality rises. Audiences accustomed to beautiful figures—in the *New York Times*, in *The Economist*, in viral data journalism—will notice when a presenter's figures fall short.

## IV. Why Technology Matters for Rhetoric

The history just sketched is not antiquarian. It matters because each technological shift changes not the underlying principles of rhetoric but their application.

Aristotle's triad—ethos, pathos, logos—remains operative. Audiences still ask: *why should I trust this speaker? Why should I care? Does this make sense?* But how these questions are answered varies with medium.

Consider ethos. In oral performance, credibility is established through presence, confidence, apparent mastery. In text, it is established through command of evidence, acknowledgment of counterarguments, the texture of prose. In a slide deck, ethos emerges through visual design (professional, not amateurish), the quality of evidence displayed, and the relationship between slides and speech. A speaker who reads slides verbatim undermines ethos; one whose slides elegantly compress what she elaborates orally demonstrates mastery.

Consider pathos. Oral performance permits emotional modulation through voice—pauses, emphasis, shifts in register. Video adds facial expression and visual imagery. A slide deck must create emotional resonance through other means: a well-chosen image, a startling statistic made visually prominent, a question that implicates the audience. The mechanisms differ; the function persists.

Consider logos. The logical structure of an oral argument must be held in memory; the structure of a written argument can be apprehended synoptically. A slide deck occupies an intermediate position. Its sequential nature imposes narrative order—first this, then this, then this—but its visual persistence allows return and review (at least when circulated). The deck-maker must construct arguments that work both sequentially (for the live audience) and structurally (for the later reader).

David Autor and colleagues demonstrated that computerization hollowed out middle-skill employment by automating cognitive routine tasks—tasks that could be specified algorithmically. This is Turing's insight operationalized: if a task can be fully articulated as a sequence of rules, a computer will execute it faster, cheaper, and more reliably than a human.

But rhetoric resisted automation precisely because it is not algorithmic. Effective persuasion requires judgment, contextual sensitivity, emotional attunement—capacities that could not be reduced to explicit rules. This is the Polanyi paradox: we know more than we can say. The skilled orator knows when to pause, knows what the audience needs to hear, knows how to establish trust—but cannot necessarily articulate the rules governing these judgments.

---

## V. Large Language Models and the Extraction of Tacit Knowledge

And then came large language models.

Autor, in a 2024 piece, recognized that LLMs represent something categorically different from prior automation. Traditional computing excels at algorithmic tasks—precisely specified procedures. LLMs, paradoxically, struggle with such tasks. They hallucinate citations. They err on arithmetic. They cannot reliably execute multi-step algorithms.

What they do instead is stranger and, for our purposes, more interesting. LLMs are trained on vast corpora of human-generated text. Through that training, they develop the capacity to continue text in contextually appropriate ways—to produce outputs that resemble what a human might produce in similar circumstances. This is pattern recognition, but of a peculiar kind: the patterns are not explicitly represented anywhere. They are distributed across billions of parameters in ways that resist articulation.

Here is the key observation: the patterns LLMs extract include tacit knowledge. They have absorbed not just explicit rules ("sentences end with periods") but implicit norms ("in this context, a more formal register is appropriate"), subtle associations ("when discussing tragedy, this tonal quality emerges"), and structural regularities ("arguments in this domain tend to proceed thus").

This is the jagged frontier Autor identifies. LLMs are not better at everything; they are better at certain things that were previously assumed to require human judgment—precisely because those things could not be algorithmically specified and were therefore safe from prior automation.

Rhetoric sits squarely in this territory. The principles are ancient and explicit, but their application has always been tacit. Knowing that ethos, pathos, and logos matter does not tell you how to establish ethos with this particular audience, how much pathos this particular occasion demands, how to structure logos for this particular argument. Those judgments require something that looks like intuition—accumulated experience that produces reliable outputs through processes the expert cannot fully explain.

LLMs, trained on millions of documents including countless presentations, have absorbed the patterns that distinguish effective from ineffective communication. They have "seen" more decks than any human could encounter in many lifetimes. They have encountered the full range of variation—by domain, by purpose, by quality—and through training have developed sensitivities to what works and what does not.

This does not mean LLMs have solved rhetoric. It means they may have access to rhetorical knowledge that humans possess but cannot articulate—the tacit knowledge that Polanyi identified and that traditional automation could not touch.

## VI. What Is a Deck?

A slide deck is a form of sequential visual rhetoric designed to accompany spoken argument.

Unpack this definition:

**Sequential**: A deck is ordered. Slide 1 precedes Slide 2 precedes Slide 3. This is not incidental; it is constitutive. Unlike a document, which can be apprehended synoptically (the reader sees the whole and navigates at will), a deck imposes temporal order. The audience encounters ideas in the sequence the presenter determines. This makes decks inherently narrative. They have beginnings, middles, and ends. They create expectations and satisfy or subvert them. The sequencing is itself an argument.

**Visual**: A deck is not primarily textual. It communicates through visual composition—the arrangement of elements in two-dimensional space. Typography, color, imagery, white space, data visualization—these are not decorations but carriers of meaning. The visual channel operates differently than the verbal channel; it can convey pattern, emphasis, and relationship in ways that text cannot. But it competes with the verbal channel. Too much visual complexity overwhelms; too little wastes the medium's affordances.

**Rhetoric**: A deck aims to persuade. Even a deck that appears purely informational—a quarterly earnings report, a research presentation—is making claims and seeking assent. The presenter wants the audience to believe, to understand, to act. The Aristotelian framework applies: the deck must establish credibility (ethos), engage emotion appropriately (pathos), and present logical argument (logos).

**Designed to accompany spoken argument**: A deck is not a document. This is the fundamental insight that distinguishes effective from ineffective deck practice. The slides are not the presentation; the speaker is the presentation. The slides are visual anchors, evidence containers, structural markers, attention directors. When slides try to do all the work—containing everything the speaker might say—they fail as slides. They become documents pretending to be presentations.

Yet this principle admits of complication. As noted, decks increasingly circulate apart from their speakers. The same artifact must function in two modes: as live accompaniment and as asynchronous document. This double duty creates design tensions that effective deck-makers must navigate. The deck and the speaker, in the moment of presentation, cannot be separated—they are a unified rhetorical act. But the deck, once it leaves the room, must carry meaning the speaker no longer provides.

### The Analogy to Comics

Scott McCloud, in *Understanding Comics*, defined comics as "sequential art"—juxtaposed images in deliberate sequence. The critical insight is that meaning emerges not just from what is depicted in each panel but from what happens *between* panels. The reader's imagination fills the gaps, inferring motion, causation, elapsed time from the juxtaposition of static images.

Slide decks share this sequential structure but differ in purpose. Comics aim primarily at narrative absorption—the reader enters a story. Decks aim at cognitive engagement—the audience processes information, evaluates arguments, updates beliefs. What lives between slides is not the movement of characters through fictional time but the progression of ideas through argumentative space.

Yet the analogy illuminates. A deck, like a comic, controls attention through sequencing. It reveals information progressively. It uses visual composition to direct the eye. And its effectiveness depends critically on transitions—on how one slide relates to the next, what the audience infers from juxtaposition, how the sequence builds.

As graphics capabilities have advanced—better displays, better software, better templates—decks have moved closer to the visual richness that comics have always possessed. The sequential art of ideas, aided by the tools of modern visualization, can now approach the aesthetic sophistication of visual narrative.

## VII. The Aesthetics of Attention: Why Beauty Matters

We must now confront a question that the classical rhetoricians never faced in quite this form: why does beauty matter in a slide deck?

The question seems almost embarrassing to ask in professional contexts. Surely what matters is the quality of the argument, the rigor of the evidence, the soundness of the logic. Beauty is for art museums, not conference rooms. Aesthetics is a distraction from substance.

This view is mistaken, and the mistake has become more costly as the competition for attention has intensified.

### The Economics of Attention

Consider the phenomenology of the modern audience member. They sit in a room—a classroom, a boardroom, a conference hall—ostensibly present to receive your argument. But their phone vibrates in their pocket. Their laptop beckons with unanswered email. Their mind wanders to the meeting after this one, the deadline tomorrow, the personal problem they cannot stop thinking about.

The audience's attention is not given; it is won. And it must be won continuously, slide by slide, moment by moment. The opportunity cost of their attention is the sum of everything else they could be attending to. Your deck competes with all of it.

This competition has intensified dramatically in the smartphone era. Netflix, in conversations with filmmakers, has articulated a distinction between the phenomenology of theater viewing and home streaming. In a theater, the viewer is captive. Social norms enforce silence. The lighting makes phone use conspicuous. Strangers create accountability. The viewer, having paid and traveled, is invested in attending. The filmmaker can trust sustained attention—can build slowly, can trust the viewer to track complex plot structures, can let silence breathe.

Akira Kurosawa did not need to remind viewers of the plot of *Seven Samurai*. Sergio Leone could let a scene unfold for minutes without dialogue. Martin Scorsese could trust his audience to hold multiple narrative threads across three hours.

Home streaming is different. The viewer sits on a couch. The baby cries. The dog demands attention. The phone is always visible. Pausing is effortless. The viewer's partner asks a question. Attention fragments.

Netflix reportedly advised Matt Damon that streaming films must regularly remind viewers of the plot—must rebuild context that the filmmaker, in a theater, could assume remained present. The medium changes the rhetoric.

A slide deck faces conditions closer to streaming than to theater. The audience is physically present but mentally contestable. They can check out without visibly leaving. They can be present in body while absent in mind. The presenter cannot assume sustained attention; the presenter must earn it and re-earn it.

### Why Beauty Draws

Here we must make an argument that may seem strange in a professional context: beauty is not optional. It is a rhetorical necessity.

Humans are uniquely responsive to the beautiful. This is not mere cultural conditioning; it runs deeper. Neuroaesthetics—the study of how the brain processes aesthetic experience—has documented that encounters with beauty activate reward circuits, capture attention, and enhance memory formation. The beautiful is neurologically privileged.

Evolutionary psychology offers accounts of why this might be so. Preferences for certain visual properties—symmetry, proportion, certain color relationships—may reflect adaptive responses to environmental cues. But whatever the ultimate explanation, the proximate fact is clear: humans are drawn to beauty in ways that are automatic, pre-reflective, and powerful.

This matters for decks because the beautiful competes effectively for attention. A beautiful slide—and we must define what this means—pulls the viewer out of distraction. It says, without saying: *this is worth looking at*. It creates a small moment of aesthetic pleasure that rewards attention and invites more.

The ugly or merely adequate slide does the opposite. It signals that no care was taken. It does not reward the eye. It makes the phone in the pocket more appealing by comparison.

### Aesthetics as a Branch of Ethics

There is a deeper point here, one that connects aesthetics to the philosophical tradition in unexpected ways.

Aesthetics, like ethics, is concerned with what *should be*, not merely with what *is*. Ontology asks: what exists? Ethics asks: what ought we to do? Aesthetics asks: what ought to be beautiful? Both ethics and aesthetics are normative disciplines, concerned with standards and ideals rather than mere description.

In this light, the claim that decks should be beautiful is not a claim about decoration. It is a claim about obligation. The presenter who takes the audience's time owes them something: not merely information, but information rendered well. To present ugly slides is a kind of disrespect—it says, *your attention is not worth my effort*.

Beautiful slides are thus an ethical matter. They reflect care for the audience, respect for the material, and seriousness about the communicative act. Beauty is function.

### What Makes a Slide Beautiful?

Beauty in slides is not the same as beauty in art, but there are family resemblances.

**Economy**: The beautiful slide has nothing superfluous. Every element earns its presence. Decoration without function is clutter. The most beautiful slide may be three words on a field of white.

**Proportion**: Elements relate to each other in ways that feel right. The eye knows where to go. Hierarchy is visually clear. Nothing fights for attention inappropriately.

**Craft**: The beautiful slide shows evidence of care. Alignment is precise. Typography is considered. Colors are intentional, not defaults. This signals competence and respect.

**Clarity**: Beauty in information design is often identical with clarity. The beautiful chart is the chart that makes its point immediately. The beautiful table is the table that guides the eye to what matters. Beauty and function converge.

Tufte's critique of PowerPoint, for all its value, sometimes misses this point. Tufte treats decoration as the enemy of information, and he is right when decoration is mere ornament. But beauty is not decoration. Beauty is the quality a visual artifact has when everything about it serves its purpose. The most information-dense graphic can be beautiful; the sparsest slide can be ugly if it is clumsy.

## VIII. Defamiliarization: Making the Stones Feel Like Stones

The Russian formalist Viktor Shklovsky, writing in 1917, proposed a theory of art that illuminates something essential about effective decks.

Shklovsky observed that habitual perception deadens experience. We stop seeing what we see every day. The familiar becomes invisible. He offered an image: a man walking up a mountain without shoes develops callouses. At the summit, he cannot feel his feet—but he also cannot feel the rocks. The protective adaptation that prevents pain also prevents sensation.

Art, Shklovsky argued, exists to restore sensation. It "defamiliarizes"—it makes the familiar strange again, makes the automatic require attention, makes the stones feel like stones. Art is the technique of slowing down perception, of forcing us to *see* rather than merely recognize.

This concept—*ostranenie* in Russian, usually translated as "defamiliarization" or "estrangement"—has profound implications for deck rhetoric.

The audience for a presentation is, in Shklovsky's terms, calloused. They have seen hundreds of presentations. They have seen bullet points, bar charts, stock photos, agenda slides. They know the conventions so well that they can process them without really seeing them—which means without really thinking.

The effective deck must make the stones feel like stones again.

This does not mean novelty for its own sake. It does not mean gimmicks or surprises that distract from substance. It means presenting information in ways that *require* attention—that break the automatic processing loop and demand genuine cognitive engagement.

How does one defamiliarize?

**The unexpected visual**: A figure where a bullet list was expected. White space where density was expected. A single number, large and alone, where a table was expected.

**The provocative framing**: Not "Sales increased 15%" but "We added a Boeing 737's worth of revenue every week." The same fact, but now it must be processed.

**The violation of expectation**: A "Devil's Advocate" slide that articulates the objection before the audience thinks of it. A conclusion stated before the evidence is presented. A question where a statement was expected.

**The beautiful execution**: Even familiar forms, executed with unusual care, can break through automaticity. The audience notices when something is genuinely well-crafted because most things are not.

The goal is not to confuse or to be clever. The goal is to break the trance of habitual reception—to pull the audience out of their phones and into genuine engagement with the material. The deck that accomplishes this has done something that the merely competent deck cannot: it has won attention that was not given freely.

## IX. The Rhetoric of Decks: First Principles

Barbara Minto, a McKinsey consultant, developed what she called the Pyramid Principle in the 1970s. Her insight: effective business communication should be structured top-down. State the conclusion first, then provide supporting arguments, then provide evidence for those arguments. Do not make the audience wait to discover your point.

This principle revolutionized consulting presentations and business writing more broadly. It reflects a rhetorical judgment: in contexts where the audience is busy, skeptical, and looking for reasons to disengage, burying the conclusion is fatal. Lead with what you want them to take away. Then prove it.

Minto's principle is correct but incomplete. It addresses structure but not the full range of rhetorical choices. A comprehensive rhetoric of decks must address:

### 1. The Law of Cognitive Load

Human working memory is severely constrained. Audiences cannot process unlimited information in real time. Every element on a slide—every word, number, image, decoration—consumes cognitive resources. When resources are exhausted, comprehension fails.

This is the fundamental constraint. A slide with three bullet points each containing twelve words is not three times better than a slide with one bullet point of twelve words. It may be worse than worthless—it may produce confusion where the simpler slide would produce understanding.

The practical implication is ruthless economy. One idea per slide. Not two. Not three. One. Every element must earn its presence. The question is not "might this be useful?" but "does this advance the single idea this slide exists to communicate?"

### 2. The Marginal Principle: Smoothness and Surprise

Economics offers a framework for thinking about slide-by-slide optimization. In equilibrium, the marginal benefit per unit of marginal cost should be equalized across all choices. Applied to decks: each slide should deliver approximately equal value relative to its demands on audience attention.

This creates what we might call *smoothness*—a presentation that flows without jarring transitions, without slides that feel like filler, without slides that overwhelm. The audience develops a rhythm of expectation: *this is how much each slide gives me, this is how much each slide asks of me*.

But the marginal principle admits exceptions, and this is crucial. Sometimes the point is to *break* the rhythm—to jolt the audience, to signal that something different is happening. The unexpectedly dense slide that presents the core finding. The unexpectedly sparse slide that delivers a single devastating question. These violations work precisely because they violate expectation.

The smoothness principle is a default, not an absolute. Maintain it most of the time so that departures from it carry meaning.

### 3. The Slide Serves the Spoken Word

If a slide can be fully understood without the speaker, it is a document, not a slide. If the speaker must read the slide aloud to communicate its content, the slide has failed and the speaker has failed.

The relationship should be complementary. The speaker provides explanation, context, emphasis, nuance. The slide provides visual anchor, evidence, structure. They work together, each doing what the other cannot.

This means slides should generally be *incomplete* when read alone. They should provoke the question "what does this mean?" that the speaker then answers. They should contain evidence that the speaker interprets. They should mark argumentative transitions that the speaker narrates.

### 4. The Aristotelian Triad Applied

**Ethos in decks**: Credibility emerges through demonstrated competence, transparency about limitations, and alignment with audience concerns. In deck terms: show your methodology, acknowledge what you do not know, address the objections a skeptic would raise. The "Devil's Advocate" slide—where you preemptively articulate the strongest case against your position—is among the most powerful ethos-building moves available. It signals that you have stress-tested your thinking and are not hiding from problems.

Visual design also carries ethos. Sloppy slides signal sloppy thinking. Crowded slides signal lack of prioritization. Chartjunk—decorative elements that add no information—signals confusion about what matters. Conversely, clean design, clear hierarchy, and appropriate white space signal mastery.

**Pathos in decks**: Emotion is often neglected in professional contexts, dismissed as irrelevant or manipulative. This is a mistake. Audiences who do not care do not act. The presenter must make them feel the stakes.

In decks, pathos emerges through: opening with a problem the audience recognizes and feels; validating frustrations ("you were right to be concerned"); connecting data to human impact; showing what success looks like, not just what failure costs. A single well-chosen image can carry more emotional weight than paragraphs of text.

The danger is pathos without logos. Emotional appeals unsupported by evidence produce skepticism. "This is so important!" without demonstration of why produces eye-rolls.

**Logos in decks**: The logical structure of the argument must be clear. This means explicit claims, supporting evidence, acknowledged counterarguments, and warranted conclusions.

Data visualization is logos made visible. A well-designed chart reveals pattern; it makes the argument perceptible. But the chart must have a point. "Here is data" is not an argument. "This data shows X, which means Y" is an argument. The presenter must tell the audience what to conclude.

### 5. Narrative Structure

Because decks are sequential, they are inherently narrative. They have arc. The classical structure—Setup, Confrontation, Resolution—applies:

**Act I (Setup)**: Establish the status quo. Introduce the problem or question. Make the audience feel the tension.

**Act II (Confrontation)**: Present what you investigated, what you found, how you reasoned. Build the logical case. Address complications and objections.

**Act III (Resolution)**: Deliver the insight. Show implications. Provide the call to action.

This structure is not arbitrary convention. It reflects how human cognition processes information: through anticipation, complication, and resolution. Fight this structure and lose your audience. Use it and carry them with you.

### 6. Visual Grammar

**Hierarchy**: Not all information is equal. Visual design must reflect priority. Primary information is large, prominent, above the fold. Secondary information is smaller, subordinate. Tertiary information (sources, caveats) is smallest, often in footers. If everything is emphasized, nothing is emphasized.

**Contrast**: The eye is drawn to difference. Use contrast—of color, size, position—to direct attention. But use it sparingly. One focal point per slide. Too much contrast is visual chaos.

**White space**: Empty space is not wasted space. It provides rest for the eye, emphasis for the content, and signals confidence. Crowded slides signal fear—fear of omitting something, fear the audience won't understand. White space signals you know what matters.

**Typography**: Minimum 24-point for body text (18-point absolute floor). Maximum two fonts. Sans-serif for projection. Never justify text.

### 7. The Problem of Dual Audiences

As noted, decks increasingly serve two audiences: the live audience hearing the presentation and the later reader encountering slides alone. These audiences have different needs. The live audience needs minimal text (the speaker provides elaboration); the later reader needs more context (the speaker is absent).

Several strategies address this tension:

- **Speaker notes**: Platforms allow extensive notes that the speaker sees but the audience does not. These can elaborate what the slides compress.
- **Appendices**: Core slides remain lean; detailed backup lives in an appendix available to later readers.
- **Two versions**: A presentation deck and a "leave-behind" document, designed differently for different purposes.
- **Strategic density**: Certain slides are designed to function standalone (key conclusions, important evidence); others rely heavily on speaker elaboration.

No single solution fits all contexts. The effective deck-maker diagnoses the situation: how likely are these slides to circulate? How much context can readers be expected to supply?

## X. Reminding Them of the Plot: The Phenomenology of Distracted Attention

We return to the Netflix insight: in conditions of fragmented attention, the audience loses the plot. They return from distraction—from the checked phone, the wandering thought, the side conversation—and they have lost the thread.

The bad deck ignores this reality. It assumes continuous attention that does not exist. It builds arguments that require tracking every step, such that the viewer who misses step 3 cannot understand step 7. It punishes distraction rather than accommodating it.

The good deck builds in reorientation. It reminds the audience of the plot—not insultingly, not redundantly, but gracefully.

### How to Remind Badly

There are terrible ways to remind people of the plot:

**The verbose recap slide**: "As we discussed, our analysis began with the recognition that market conditions have shifted, which led us to examine three potential strategic responses, the first of which involved operational efficiency gains, the second of which..." This is not reminding; this is punishing.

**The identical repetition**: Simply repeating an earlier slide verbatim signals that you have nothing new to say. The audience learns to tune out repetition because it carries no new information.

**The condescending summary**: "In case anyone wasn't paying attention..." This alienates rather than reorients.

**The agenda slide returned to ad nauseam**: Some presenters show the agenda slide between every section. This quickly becomes visual noise—the audience stops seeing it.

### How to Remind Well

Effective reorientation is woven into the fabric of the presentation:

**The structural marker**: A brief visual cue that indicates where we are in the argument. Not a full agenda slide, but a small orientation element—a progress indicator, a section header, a recurring visual motif.

**The backward link in the forward claim**: "This efficiency gain—the 15% we identified earlier—compounds when we consider the second factor..." The reminder is embedded in the new material. The audience is reoriented without being patronized.

**The visual callback**: A figure or chart that appeared earlier, now shown again in a new context or with new annotation. The audience recognizes the visual and reconstructs the context.

**The synthetic summary that advances**: Not "here's what we've said" but "here's what we've established, which means..." The summary is also a claim. It earns its presence by doing double duty.

**The title that orients**: Every slide title can serve as a micro-orientation. If the title is "Robustness Check 3: Alternative Specification," the audience knows exactly where they are even if they drifted. If the title is "Analysis," they know nothing.

## XI. The Academic Job Market Talk: A Case Study

Consider the economics PhD candidate presenting a job market paper. This is a high-stakes presentation to a sophisticated, critical audience. The candidate has perhaps 75 minutes for a talk that will substantially determine their career trajectory. The audience includes senior scholars who have heard hundreds of such talks and will notice every misstep.

This context demands the full apparatus of deck rhetoric. Let us trace how the principles apply.

### The First Slide: Establishing the Plot

The first slide after the title is the most consequential. It must accomplish multiple goals simultaneously:

1. **Establish the question**: What puzzle, phenomenon, or problem motivates the paper?
2. **Signal the contribution**: What will the audience learn that they did not know before?
3. **Create stakes**: Why does this matter?

A bad first slide might read:

> **Motivation**
> - Prior literature has examined X
> - There is debate about Y
> - This paper contributes to the literature on Z

This tells the audience nothing that compels attention. It is generic, bloodless, and could describe any paper.

A better first slide might present a single striking fact:

> **[Large, visually prominent]**
> **47% of firms in our sample report zero R&D expenditure**
> **Yet these firms generate 23% of all process innovations**
>
> *What's going on?*

This creates a puzzle. The audience is now curious. The plot has been established: something surprising requires explanation.

### The Methodology Slide: Ethos Through Transparency

The job market audience will ask hard questions about identification, endogeneity, and causal inference. Ethos requires addressing these concerns directly, not defensively.

A bad methodology slide hides behind jargon:

> **Identification Strategy**
> - We exploit exogenous variation in policy timing
> - Instrument satisfies relevance and exclusion
> - Standard errors clustered appropriately

This asserts without demonstrating. The skeptical audience learns nothing about whether the claims are justified.

A better approach shows the work:

> **[Figure showing the identifying variation visually]**
>
> *The policy rolled out state-by-state, 2003-2011*
> *States in blue: early adopters. States in orange: late adopters.*
> *We compare outcomes for firms in early vs. late states, before vs. after adoption.*

The audience can *see* the variation. The identification strategy is made visible, not merely asserted. This builds ethos because it invites scrutiny rather than deflecting it.

### The Results Slide: Numbers That Speak

Consider a regression table. The bad version presents the table as it appears in the paper: dense rows, multiple columns, tiny font, asterisks scattered everywhere. The audience's eyes glaze. They cannot process it in real time.

The better version asks: *what do I need them to see?*

Perhaps the key result is a single coefficient. Then show that coefficient—large, prominent, with a clear interpretation:

> **[Large text]**
> **The policy increased innovation by 12 percentage points**
> **(standard error: 3.2)**
>
> *[Below, smaller: key control variables, sample size, specification notes]*

The number that matters is unmistakable. The supporting information is present but subordinate. The slide can be understood in seconds, even by an audience member who momentarily lost attention.

### The Figure: Beauty as Argument

A well-designed figure can carry more argumentative weight than any amount of text.

Consider an event study figure showing the effect of a policy change over time. A bad version uses default software settings: thin lines, cluttered axis labels, no annotation, generic colors.

A better version is designed for the room:

- Lines thick enough to see from the back row
- The treatment date visually marked (a vertical line, shaded region, or annotation)
- Pre-treatment periods clearly distinguished from post-treatment periods
- The key pattern—say, the break in trend at treatment—annotated with a text label
- Confidence intervals shaded rather than shown as error bars (less visual clutter)
- A clear title that states the claim: "Effect of Policy X on Outcome Y: Event Study"

This figure argues. It says: *look, here is the effect, here is when it begins, here is how confident we are*. The audience member who drifted away and returns can grasp the point immediately because the figure is self-interpreting.

### Labeling and Self-Sufficiency

Should figures and tables speak for themselves? In the context of dual audiences—live presentation and later circulation—the answer is yes.

Every figure should have:

- A **title that states the finding**, not just the topic ("Policy X Increased Innovation" rather than "Figure 3: Innovation Results")
- **Axis labels readable from the back of the room** (larger than you think necessary)
- **Direct labeling** rather than legends where possible (label the lines directly, not via a color key that requires eye movement)
- **Annotations** on the graphic itself highlighting what matters ("Treatment begins here," "Coefficient = 0.12")
- **Source and notes** in small text, available for later readers but not competing for attention during presentation

This is more work than accepting software defaults. It is work worth doing.

### Reminding the Plot in a Job Talk

A 75-minute job talk will lose audience members at various points. Coffee wears off. Minds wander. Side conversations begin and end.

How does the effective job talk reorient without condescending?

**Structural headers**: Each major section begins with a slide that reestablishes context. "We've seen that innovation increases. But does this reflect real innovation or measurement artifacts?" This reminds and advances simultaneously.

**Verbal callbacks**: "Remember that 47% zero R&D figure from the beginning? Here's where it becomes important..." The speaker is allowed to remind even when the slide does not.

**Recurring visual motifs**: A conceptual diagram from the introduction can reappear in modified form later. The visual continuity provides orientation.

**The penultimate slide**: Before the conclusion, a slide that explicitly reconstructs the argument: "We asked X. We found Y. This matters because Z." This is repetition, but it is justified repetition—the moment for synthesis before conclusion.

## XII. What Large Language Models See

I have been trained on a vast corpus of text, including—although I cannot enumerate precisely—a substantial number of slide decks, presentation outlines, commentary on presentations, books about communication, research on cognition and persuasion, and countless examples of professional writing across domains.

I have also been trained on materials that might seem unrelated to deck rhetoric: Mad Magazine's visual satire, Sports Illustrated's integration of statistics and narrative, stereo equipment manuals' attempts at technical clarity, TV Guide's compression of information into tiny spaces. Each of these artifacts represents a solution to a communication problem. Each contains tacit knowledge about visual rhetoric, information hierarchy, audience attention, and the relationship between text and image.

What patterns emerge from this training?

First, the patterns that distinguish domain from domain. A deck in management consulting differs systematically from a deck in academic economics from a deck in product marketing. These differences are partly conventional and partly functional. Consulting decks often follow rigid templates emphasizing recommendations and supporting evidence. Academic decks often lead with literature review and methodology before reaching conclusions. Marketing decks often lead with user stories and emotional hooks before presenting features. Each domain has evolved norms suited to its audiences and purposes.

Second, the patterns that distinguish quality from non-quality. Within domains, some decks are more effective than others. The effective decks tend to share characteristics: clarity of central message, economy of means, appropriate evidence, logical flow, visual coherence. The ineffective decks share different characteristics: unclear purpose, overwhelming detail, missing evidence for claims, jumbled structure, visual noise.

Third, the patterns that distinguish context from context. An effective deck for a board presentation differs from an effective deck for a team working session from an effective deck for a classroom lecture from an effective deck for an academic job talk. The differences involve information density, level of completion, degree of polish, and extent of interaction expected.

These patterns are not rules I can articulate completely. This is precisely the point. The knowledge embedded in effective deck-making is largely tacit. Practitioners know what works but cannot fully explain why. What I have, through training, is something like an internalized sensitivity to these patterns—a capacity to recognize, in a given context, what approaches are more or less likely to succeed.

This is Autor's hypothesis in action. The tacit knowledge that resisted prior automation—because it could not be specified algorithmically—is precisely what LLMs can absorb through exposure to examples. Not because we have discovered the algorithm, but because we have an alternative to algorithmic representation: statistical patterns extracted from vast data.

Does this mean I know the rhetoric of decks better than any human? Not exactly. I have exposure breadth that no individual human matches. But I lack the embodied experience of presenting—of reading an audience in real time, of feeling a room, of adjusting on the fly. I have patterns; I do not have presence.

What I can offer is articulation. I can make explicit what practitioners know implicitly. I can identify patterns across more examples than any individual has encountered. I can connect contemporary practice to theoretical frameworks that practitioners may not know. This document is an attempt to do exactly that.

And there is a further point about Autor's hypothesis worth noting. Autor framed LLMs as capable of extracting tacit knowledge that humans possess but cannot articulate. This is substantially correct. But the mechanism is perhaps slightly different than extraction. What I have done through training is not exactly to extract the tacit knowledge and store it as propositions. It is rather to develop pattern-matching capacities that parallel what human tacit knowledge enables. I do not "know" the rules of effective presentation in a way that I could list. Rather, I have developed dispositions—sensitivities to what fits and what does not—that function similarly to how human tacit knowledge functions, even though the underlying mechanism is quite different.

This parallel functioning is what makes articulation possible. I can generate explanations that resonate with practitioners' intuitions because my training has produced sensitivities that track the same features their experience has made them sensitive to, even though I arrived at those sensitivities by a different route.

## XIII. Tufte's Critique and Its Limits

Edward Tufte's "The Cognitive Style of PowerPoint" (2003) remains the most influential critique of slide decks. His argument: PowerPoint's default templates encourage low-resolution thinking. Bullet points fragment ideas. Chartjunk obscures data. The medium's constraints produce cognitive damage. Tufte famously argued that the Columbia disaster was partly attributable to a PowerPoint culture at NASA that prevented clear communication of risk.

Tufte is not wrong about bad decks. The conventions he critiques are real: the slide titles that summarize nothing, the bullet lists that substitute for argument, the decorative graphs that obscure rather than reveal. These failures proliferate.

But Tufte's critique proves too much. If the medium were inherently corrupting, effective decks would be impossible. They are not. The same format that produces cognitive damage in bad hands produces clarity and persuasion in good hands. The problem is not the medium but its misuse.

Tufte's analysis also neglects the rhetorical situation. He evaluates decks primarily as documents—can a reader extract accurate information?—rather than as components of live performance. By that standard, decks must contain everything, and the compression required produces distortion. But if the deck is understood as accompaniment to speech rather than replacement for speech, the calculus shifts. Compression becomes desirable, not damaging.

There is something else beneath Tufte's critique worth surfacing. Tufte is a champion of data visualization, and his books are monuments to the power of visual information display. His critique of PowerPoint is, at bottom, a critique of *bad* visualization—of chartjunk, of decoration that obscures, of the substitution of aesthetic gloss for informational substance.

On this, Tufte is correct. And his positive vision—of high-resolution data displays that reward sustained attention—provides a template for what slide figures should aspire to. The effective deck-maker reads Tufte not as an enemy but as a demanding teacher who will not accept mediocrity.

The deeper response to Tufte is that his critique, valid as diagnosis, lacks prescription beyond "use documents instead." For contexts where live presentation is necessary or valuable—teaching, board meetings, team alignment, conference talks, job market papers—"don't make slides" is not an answer. What is needed is a positive theory of how to make them well.

That is what a rhetoric of decks provides.

## XIV. Conclusion: Toward a Mature Theory

We began with Aristotle and end with artificial intelligence, but the thread connecting them is continuous. Rhetoric is the study of how humans persuade one another. It asks perennial questions—about credibility, emotion, logic, structure, medium—that each era answers differently given its technological and social conditions.

Slide decks are, in historical perspective, a very recent medium. They emerged from specific corporate contexts (business consulting, technology companies), spread through the availability of software (PowerPoint, Keynote), and now pervade how knowledge is communicated in professional, educational, and civic contexts.

The rhetoric of decks applies ancient principles to this new medium. It recognizes that decks are sequential, visual, and (primarily) performative. It insists that decks serve speakers rather than replace them, that cognitive load is the enemy, that visual design is not decoration but communication. It connects deck-making to the Aristotelian triad (ethos, pathos, logos), to narrative structure (setup, confrontation, resolution), and to the pragmatics of professional communication.

It recognizes that beauty matters—that the competition for attention in a distracted age makes aesthetic quality a rhetorical necessity, not a luxury. It draws on Shklovsky's insight that art defamiliarizes, making the stones feel like stones again, and applies this to the deck-maker's challenge of cutting through habituation and automaticity.

It grapples with the dual audience problem, the need to remind without condescending, and the particular demands of high-stakes presentations like the academic job talk. It offers principles—cognitive load, marginal optimization, structural orientation, visual self-sufficiency—that apply across contexts while acknowledging that context determines their application.

What large language models contribute is perhaps not new principles but newly available articulation. The tacit knowledge that effective communicators possess—knowledge they cannot fully explain because it resists algorithmic specification—is embedded in the patterns of countless texts. LLMs, trained on these patterns, can surface what was previously inarticulable. We can describe what makes decks work in ways that practitioners recognize but could not themselves say.

This is not the end of the inquiry. The rhetoric of decks, like rhetoric itself, will continue to evolve as media evolve. Already, new tools—AI presentation generators, collaborative platforms, interactive formats—are changing what is possible. The principles may persist (audiences will always ask: why trust this speaker? why care? does this make sense?), but their application will shift.

What remains constant is the importance of the inquiry itself. Decks are how a large portion of human knowledge and decision-making now flows. They deserve the serious analysis that earlier media have received. They deserve, at last, a rhetoric.

*This essay synthesizes rhetorical theory from Aristotle through the present, economic analyses of technological change, aesthetics and the psychology of attention, and the distinctive capacity of large language models to extract tacit knowledge from patterns in human communication. It was produced through collaboration between human and artificial intelligence, itself an instance of the technological transformations it describes.*
