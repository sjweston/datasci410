But plan to use AI extensively in your future career.\nAI tools like ChatGPT, Claude, and GitHub Copilot are transforming data science work. You should learn to use them effectively — but not yet. This course prohibits AI assistance on all assessments:\n\nWeekly coding assignments\nIn-class coding exercises\nReading quizzes\nFinal project\n\nWhy no AI?\nThink of it like going to the gym. You don’t hire someone to lift the weights for you — the struggle is the point. The goal is to build mental muscle: understanding why code works, debugging when it doesn’t, and developing intuition about data structures.\nUsing AI before you have these foundations creates an “illusion of competence.” The code works, so it feels like you understand it. But when the AI hallucinates (and it will), you can’t debug it. You’re stranded.\nResearch shows that AI coding tools are most effective when used for augmentation (enhancing what you already know) rather than automation (doing what you don’t understand). In Anthropic’s Economic Index (January 2026), AI output quality was strongly correlated with the user’s education level and domain expertise — AI amplifies your existing skills, it doesn’t replace them (Anthropic, 2026).\nBy building a strong foundation now, you’ll be in a far better position to leverage AI as a collaborator in your future work."

These don’t need to be publication-ready — they’re exploratory. But they should:\n\nUse appropriate geoms for the data type\nHave labeled axes and a title\nShow something meaningful (not just geom_point(aes(x, y)) with no context)\n\n\n\n3. Bullet-point outline of findings\nAfter your code, include a brief section (in comments or markdown) with:\n\nWhat patterns or trends do you see so far?\nWere there any surprises?\nDid your research questions change based on what you found?\n\n\n\n4.

Add a title, your name, and today’s date in the YAML header\nWrite a short introduction in Markdown — use headers, bold, italic, and a bulleted list\nAdd a code chunk that loads a dataset and creates a plot. Try #| echo: false to hide the code\nUse inline code to report a summary statistic in a sentence (e.g., “The mean age was `r knitr::inline_expr(\"mean(data$age)\")`”)\nRender your document to HTML. Then try PDF (you may need to install tinytex)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteThe golden rule of reproducibility\n\n\n\nNever hard-code a number in your text. If your data changes, your text should update automatically.\nInstead of: &gt; “The mean score was 4.2.”\nWrite: &gt; “The mean score was `r knitr::inline_expr(\"round(mean(data$score, na.rm = TRUE), 1)\")`.”\nThis way, if you add more data or fix an error, everything stays in sync.\n\n\n\nUseful chunk options\n#| label: fig-results\n#| echo: false\n#| fig-cap: \"Mean anxiety scores by condition\"\n#| fig-width: 8\n#| fig-height: 5\n\nggplot(data, aes(x = condition, y = anxiety)) +\n  stat_summary(fun = mean, geom = \"bar\") +\n  stat_summary(fun.data = mean_se, geom = \"errorbar\", width = 0.2)",
