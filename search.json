However, this course focuses on building foundational skills that AI cannot replace: understanding why code works, debugging when it doesn’t, and developing the judgment to know when output is correct.\nFor this reason, assessments in this course fall into two categories:\nAI-Restricted Assessments:\n\nIn-class coding exercises\nTimed reading quizzes (Canvas with Lockdown Browser)\n\nThese must be completed without AI assistance. The goal is to build your mental models and muscle memory for R programming.\nAI-Permitted Assessments (with documentation):\n\nWeekly coding assignments\nFinal project\n\nFor these assessments, you may use AI tools, but you must:\n\nCite your use — Note which tool you used and for what purpose\nDocument the process — Include a brief reflection on what the AI got right, what it got wrong, and what you had to modify\nUnderstand your code — You should be able to explain every line. I may ask you to walk me through your code verbally.\n\nWhy this approach? Learning to code is like learning a language — you need to struggle through the basics before a translator becomes useful rather than a crutch. Once you understand the fundamentals, AI becomes a powerful collaborator rather than a black box.\n\n\nAccessibility\n[Add accessibility statement]\n\n\nBasic Needs\n[Add basic needs resources]"
